## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added several new English version/translation Bibles:
  - American King James Version (AKJV)
  - Bible in Basic English (BBE)
  - Bible in Worldwide English NT (BWE)
  - Darby (DAR)
  - Diaglot NT - 1865 (DIAGLOT)
  - Douay-Rheims (DR)
  - The Emphasized Bible by J. B. Rotherham (ROTHERHAM)
  - Geneva Bible (GB)
  - Leeser Old Testament (LEESER)

  - Montgomery New Testament (MONT)
  - New Heart English Bible (NHEB)
  - Open English Bible (OEB)
  - The Peschito Syriac New Testament (ETHERIDGE)
  - Revised 1833 Webster Version (RWEBSTER)
  - Revised Young's Literal Translation NT (RYLT)
  - Updated King James Version (UKJV)
  - Webster (WBS)
  - Wesley's New Testament (WESLEY)
  - Weymouth NT (WMTH)
  - Willam Tyndale Bible (TYN)
  - World English Bible (WEB)
  - Wycliffe Bible (WYC)
  - Young's Literal Translation of the Bible (YLT)
- Added functionality to the Bible class to be able to get the books, chapter numbers, and verse numbers for the given version/translation.

### Changed

- Modified the header image url to be an absolute url so that it hopefully shows up in PyPI correctly.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Modified the NormalizedReference class to allow start chapter, start verse, end chapter, and end verse to be None.
  - The parser has also been updated to set those values to None unless they are explicitly set in the reference string. As we added more version/translation Bible texts, we realized the differences in chapter and verse numbers between versions/translations was much greater than initially assumed. This change allows for more flexibility in handling those differences.
  - The formatter has also been updated to get the appropriate start chapter, start verse, end chapter, and end verse at format time rather than parse time.
