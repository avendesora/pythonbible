    """The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren; And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Thamar, and Pharez begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram; And Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon; And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse; And Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon, of the wife of Uriah; And Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa; And Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram, and Jehoram begat Uzziah; And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah; And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah; And Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon. And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zerubbabel; And Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor; And Azor begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud; And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob; And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations: and from David to the Babylonish captivity are fourteen generations, and from the Babylonish captivity to Christ are fourteen generations. Now the birth of Christ was on this wise: His mother Mary, being espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and yet not willing to make her a publick example, purposed to put her away privily. But while he was thinking on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is begotten in her, is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.(Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold the virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.) Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: But he knew her not, till she had brought forth her Son, the first-born. And he called his name Jesus. Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold wise men came from the East to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him. And having assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he demanded of them, Where the Christ was to be born? And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, art in no wise the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Ruler, who shall feed my people Israel. Then Herod, having privately called the wise men, inquired of them with great exactness, at what time the star appeared: And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go, inquire exactly concerning the young child, and if ye find him, bring me word again, that I also may come and worship him. And having heard the king, they departed; and lo the star which they had seen in the East, moved on before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. And seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And being come into the house, they saw the young child, with Mary his mother; and falling down, they worshiped him. And opening their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream, not to return to Herod, they went back into their own country another way. And when they were gone back, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and continue there till I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. And he arose, and took the young child and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt, And continued there till the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. Then Herod, seeing that he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sending forth, slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the confines thereof, from two years old and under; according to the time which he had exactly inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the young child's life. And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel, But having heard, Archelaus reigneth over Judea, in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither, and being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee. And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. In those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea. And saying, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. And this John had his raiment of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their Sins. But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Ye serpents, ye brood of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance: And say not within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father; for I say to you, God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. But even the axe already lieth at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I; whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather the wheat into the garner, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And Jesus being baptized, went up straightway from the water, and lo the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him. And lo a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight. Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil. And having fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterwards hungry. And the tempter coming to him said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh him with him into the holy city, and setteth him on the battlement of the temple, And saith to him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall charge his angels concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said to him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again the devil taketh him with him to an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, And saith to him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then Jesus saith to him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and behold angels came and waited upon him. But when Jesus heard, that John was cast into prison, he retired into Galilee. And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zebulon and Naphthali: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulon and the land of Naphthali, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, The people who walked in darkness, saw a great light, and to them who sat in the region of the shadow of death, light is sprung up. From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers. And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And straitway leaving the nets they followed him. And going on from thence, he saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a vessel with Zebedee their father mending their nets; and he called them. And leaving the vessel and their father, they immediately followed him. And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease, and all manner of malady among the people. And his fame went thro' all Syria; and they brought to him all sick people, that were seized with divers diseases and tormenting pains; even demoniacs, and lunaticks, and paralytics; and he healed them. And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis, and Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond Jordan. And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he was set down his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying, Happy are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Happy are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted. Happy are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth. Happy are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be satisfied. Happy are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy. Happy are the pure in heart; for they shall see God. Happy are the peace-makers; for they shall be called the children of God. Happy are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Happy are ye when men shall revile and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you. Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is situated on a mountain cannot be hid. Neither do they light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy but to fulfill. For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all things be effected. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments and teach men so, shall be the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and each them, he shall be great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say to you, That unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. Ye have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt do no murder, and whosoever doth murder, shall be liable to the judgment. But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be liable to the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to hell-fire. Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember, that thy brother hath ought against thee, Leaving thy gift there before the altar, go; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt in no wise come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing. Ye have heard, that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery. But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. But if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. And if thy right-hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of Divorce. But I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, save for the cause of whoredom, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away, committeth adultery. Again, ye have heard, that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform thine oaths unto the Lord. But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne. Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head; for thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your conversation be yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of the evil one. Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say unto you, that ye resist not the evil man: but whosoever shall smite thee on the right-cheek, turn to him the other also; And if a man will sue thee and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go with him one mile, go with him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. Ye have heard, that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you: That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the heathens so? Therefore ye shall be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect. Take heed that ye practise not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Therefore when thou dost alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward. But when thou dost alms, let not thy left-hand know what thy right-hand doth: That thy alms may be in secret, and thy father who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou shall not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may appear to men: verily I say unto you, they have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens; for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. Thus therefore pray ye, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast: verily I say unto you, they have their reward. But thou when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face. That thou appear not unto men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break thro' and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break thro' nor steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The eye is the light of the body: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness: if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness? No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will cleave to the one and neglect the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take not thought for your life, what ye shall eat, nor for the body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the birds of the air: they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? And which of you by taking thought can add to his age the smallest measure? And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now: if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the still, will he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take not thought, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or what shall we wear?(For after all these things do the heathens seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye need all these things, But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Take not therefore thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for itself: sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you. And why beholdest thou the mote in thy brother's eye, but observest not the beam in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote from thine eye, and behold a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye. Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turning, rend you. Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. What man is there of you, who if his son ask bread, will give him a stone? And if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him? Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets. Enter ye in thro' the straight gate: for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are that go in thro' it: Because straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there are that find it. But beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? So every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name have done many wonderful works? And then will I declare to them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Therefore whosoever heareth these my sayings, and doth them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell not; for it was founded on a rock. But every one that heareth these my sayings, and doth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house on the sand. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it. And when Jesus had ended these sayings, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching, For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. And when he was come down from the Mountain, great multitudes followed him. And behold a leper came and worshiped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus stretching forth his hand, touched him, saying, I will; Be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus saith to him, See thou tell no man, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him, and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the house, ill of the palsy, grievously tormented. And Jesus saith to him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy, that thou shouldst come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it. When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go thy way, and as thou hast believed, be it to thee. And his servant was healed in that hour. And Jesus coming into Peter's house, saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever. And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and waited upon them. When it was evening, they brought to him many demoniacs; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were ill: Whereby was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our diseases. And Jesus seeing great multitudes about him, commanded to go to the other side. And a certain scribe came and said to him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus saith to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the deadto bury their dead. And when he was come into the vessel, his disciples followed him. And behold there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the vessel was covered with the waves. But he was asleep. And his disciples coming to him awoke him, saying, Lord, save us; we perish. And he saith to them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then arising, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and seas obey him? And when he was come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way. And behold they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time? And there was afar off from them an herd of many swine feeding. So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine. And he said to them, Go. And coming out, they went into the herd of swine, and behold the whole herd rushed down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. But they that kept them fled, and going into the city, told every thing, and what had befallen the demoniacs. And behold the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and seeing him, they besought him, to depart out of their coasts. And going into the vessel, he passed over, and came to his own city. And behold they brought to him a paralytic, lying on a couch; and Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, Take courage: thy sins are forgiven thee. And behold certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. And Jesus seeing their thoughts said, Why think ye evil in your hearts? For which is easier? To say, Thy sins are forgiven thee? Or to say, Arise and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the paralytic) Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thy house. And he arose and went to his own house. And the multitude seeing it, marvelled, and glorified God, who had given such power to men. And as Jesus passed along from thence, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the receit of custom, and saith to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. And as Jesus sat at table in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with him and his disciples. And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples, Why eateth your master with publicans and sinners? But Jesus hearing it, said to them, They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice; for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples fast not? And Jesus said, Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bride-groom is with them? But the days will come, when the bride-groom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. No man putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: for that which is put in to fill it; taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse. Neither do men put new wine into old leather bottles, else the bottles burst, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are destroyed, but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. While he spake these things to them, behold a certain ruler coming worshiped him, saying, My daughter is even now dying: but come and lay thine hand on her, and she shall live. And Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples.(And behold a woman who had had a flux of blood, twelve years, coming behind him, touched the hem of his garment. For she said within herself, if I but touch his garment, I shall be whole. And Jesus turning and seeing her, said, Daughter, take courage; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.) And Jesus coming into the ruler's house, and seeing the minstrels and the croud who cried out aloud, Saith to them, Withdraw; for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth: and they derided him. But when the people were put forth, he went in and took her by the hand; and the maid arose. And the fame of it went abroad into all that country. And when Jesus passed thence, two blind men followed him, crying and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us. And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith to them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yea, Lord. Then he touched their eyes, saying, Be it unto you, according to your faith. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. But when they were gone out, they spread his fame in all that country. As they were going out, behold men brought a dumb demoniac to him. And when the devil were cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never seen thus, even in Israel. But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people. But seeing the multitudes he was moved with tender compassion for them, because they were faint and scattered, as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he to his disciples, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal every disease and every malady. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; the first, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was Thaddeus; Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent forth, having commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into a city of the Samaritans enter not: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as ye go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses: Nor scrip for your journey, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor yet a staff: for the workman is worthy of his maintenance. And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till ye go thence. And when ye come into an house, salute it. And if the house be worthy, your peace shall come upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace shall return to you. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words; when ye go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. But beware of men; for they will deliver you to the councils, and scourge you in their synagogues. And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the heathens. But when they deliver you, take no thought, how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that very hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of the Father who speaketh in you. But the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and children shall rise up against their parents, and kill them. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end, shall be saved. But when they persecute you in this city, flee to another; for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come. The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his houshold? Therefore fear them not; for there is nothing covered, that shall not be discovered; nor hid, that shall not be known. What I tell you in darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim on the house-tops. And be not afraid of them who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father. Yea, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven. Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I am not come to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance with his father, and the daughter with her mother, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law. And the foes of a man shall be they of his own houshold. He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me, and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me; And he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life, shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it. He that entertaineth you, entertaineth me; and he that entertaineth me, entertaineth him that sent me. He that entertaineth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward: and he that entertaineth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. And when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence, to teach and to preach in their cities. Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, And said to him, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another? And Jesus answering said to them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see. The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them: And happy is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me. And as they departed, Jesus said to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that wear soft clothing, are in king's houses. But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet. For this is he of whom it is written, Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee. Verily I say unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he. And from the days of John the Baptist till now, the kingdom of heaven is entered by force, and they which strive with all their might take it by violence. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if ye are willing to receive him, this is Elijah, who was to come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. But whereto shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows, And saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to tou, and ye have not lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He hath a devil. The Son of man is come eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners; but wisdom is justified by her children. Then began he to upbraid the cities, wherein most of his mighty works had been done, because they repented not. Wo to thee, Chorazin, wo to thee, Bethsaida: for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. Moreover I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. And thou, Capernaum, who hast been exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained till this day. But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you. At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any one the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him. Come to me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. At that time Jesus went on the sabbath thro' the corn, and his disciples were hungry, and plucked the ears of corn and ate. But the Pharisees seeing it said to him, Behold thy disciples do what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath. But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him? How he entered into the house of God, and ate the shew-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them who were with him, but only for the priests? Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath-days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless? But I say to you, That one greater than the temple is here. And if ye had known what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath. And departing thence, he went into their synagogue. And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him. And he said to them, What man is there among you, that shall have one sheep, who if it fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold on it and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath-day. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other. Then the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might kill him. And Jesus knowing it withdrew from thence; and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all. And charged them, not to make him known: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delighteth: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the heathens. He shall not strive nor clamour, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. He shall not break a bruised reed, and smoking flax he shall not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. And in his name shall the heathens trust. Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb; and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. And the multitude were amazed and said, Is not this the Son of David? But the Pharisees hearing it said, This fellow casteth not out devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not be established. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself: how then shall his kingdom stand? And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if it be by the Spirit of God that I cast out devils, then the kingdom of God is come upon you. How can one enter into the strong one's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong one? And then he will plunder his house. He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. Wherefore I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men. And whosoever speaketh against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that to come. Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit. Ye brood of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say to you, That every idle word which men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, or by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. And he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign, and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold a greater than Jonah is here. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it; for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold a greater than Solomon is here. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return to my house whence I came out, and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept and garnished. Then goeth he and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there, and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it be also to this wicked generation. While he yet talked to the multitude, behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him. And one said to him, Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee. And he answering said to him that told him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? And stretching forth his hand toward his disciples he said, Behold my mother and my brethren. For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother. The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the seaside. And great multitudes were gathered together, to him, so that he went into the vessel and sat, and all the multitude stood on the shore. And he spake many things to them in parables, saying, Behold a sower went forth to sow. And while he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them. Others fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth; and they sprung up immediately, because they had not depth of earth. And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had not root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up and choked them. And others fell on good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundred fold, some sixty, some thirty. He that hath ears to hear let him hear. And the disciples came and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables? He answered and said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even what he hath. Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah who saith, Hearing ye will hear, but in no wise understand, and seeing ye will see, but in no wise perceive. For the heart of this people is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed: lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and should be converted and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say to you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them. Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and considereth it not, the wicked one cometh, and catcheth away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the way-side. But he who received the seed in stony places, is he that heareth the word, and immediately receiveth it with joy. Yet hath he not root in himself, and so endureth but for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straight-way he is offended. He that received the seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word: and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. But he that received seed on the good ground, is he that heareth the word and considereth it: who also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth some an hundred fold, some sixty, some thirty. He proposed to them another parable, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man sowing good seed in his field. But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amidst the wheat, and went away. And when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the darnel also. So the servants of the housholder came to him and said, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? Whence then hath it darnel? He said to them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said to him, Wilt thou then, that we go and gather them up? But he said, No: lest gathering up the darnel, ye root up the wheat with them. Suffer both to grow together till the harvest; and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the darnel, and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn. He proposed to them another parable, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field: Which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest of herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches of it. He spake another parable to them: the kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman taking, covered up in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. All these things spake Jesus to the multitude in parables, and without a parable spake he not unto them: Whereby was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hid from the foundation of the world. Then Jesus having sent the multitude away, went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Declare to us the parable of the darnel of the field. He answering said to them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man. The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the darnel are the children of the wicked one. The enemy that sowed them is the devil: the harvest is the end of the world; the reapers are the angels. As therefore the darnel are gathered and burnt with fire, so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity. And shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which a man having found hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls: Who having found one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea, and gathering of every kind. Which when it was full, they drew to the shore, and sitting down, gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just. And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Jesus saith to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, Lord. Then saith he to them, Therefore every scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like an housholder, who bringeth out of his treasure things new and old. And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence: And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, Whence hath HE this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brethren, James and Joses and Simon and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath HE all these things? And they were offended at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. And he wrought not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus, And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist: he is risen from the dead, and therefore these mighty powers exert themselves in him. For Herod had apprehended John, and bound him and put him in prison, for Herodias sake, his brother Philip's wife. For John had said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they accounted him a prophet. But when Herod's birth-day was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod. Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatever she should ask. And being before instructed by her mother, she said, Give me here John the Baptist's head in a charger. And the king was sorry; yet for the oath's sake, and them who sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given her. And he sent and beheaded John in the prison. And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel, and she carried it to her mother. And his disciples came and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. And Jesus hearing it, withdrew thence by ship into a desert place apart: but when the people heard thereof, they followed him by land out of the cities. And going forth he saw a great multitude, and was moved with tender compassion for them, and healed their sick. And in the evening his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past: send the multitude away, that going into the villages, they may buy themselves victuals. But Jesus said to them, They need not go: give ye them to eat. They say to him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes. He said, Bring them hither to me. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they all ate and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And they that had eaten were about five thousand, beside women and children. And he constrained his disciples, to go straightway into the vessel, and go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitude away. And having sent the multitude away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray. And in the evening, he was there alone: but the vessel was now in the midst of the sea, tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary. In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. And the disciples seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition: and they cried out for fear. But Jesus immediately spake to them, saying, Take courage: it is I: be not afraid. And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water. And he said, Come. And Peter coming down from the vessel, walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus reaching forth his hand, caught him, and saith to him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the vessel, the wind ceased. Then they that were in the vessel, came and worshiped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. And having crossed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought to him all that were diseased; And besought him, that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole. Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees who were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answering said, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God thro' your tradition? For God commanded, Honour thy father and mother: and He that revileth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest have been profited by me: Let him not honour his father or his mother. Thus have ye made void the command of God thro' your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophecy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh to me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. And calling the multitudes he said to them, Hear and understand. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the man, but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth the man. Then came his disciples and said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees, hearing this saying, were offended? He answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind: but if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a ditch. Then answered Peter and said to him, Declare to us this parable. And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? Do not ye yet understand, that whatever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the vault? But those things which proceed out of the mouth, come out of the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings. These are the things which defile a man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. And Jesus going thence, retired to the coast of Tyre and Sidon. And behold a woman of Canaan, of those coasts, came and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth after us. But he answering said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then came she and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answering said, It is not right, to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. And she said, True, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table. And Jesus answering said to her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour. And Jesus passing thence, came nigh the sea of Galilee; and going up into a mountain, he sat down there. And great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, disabled, and many others; and cast them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them: So that the multitudes wondered, seeing the dumb to speak, the disabled whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. Then Jesus calling his disciples to him said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I am not willing to send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so much bread in a wilderness, as to satisfy so great a multitude? And Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven, and a few small fishes. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass. And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, he gave thanks and brake them and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up of the fragments that remained seven baskets full. And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children. And having sent away the multitude, he took ship again, and came into the coasts of Magdala. Then the Parisees and Saducees came and tempting, desired him to shew them a sign from heaven. He answering said to them, In the evening ye say, It will be fair weather; for the sky is red: And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day; for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye know to discern the face of the sky: can ye not discern the signs of the times? A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh a sign; but there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them and departed. And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. And Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Saducees. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We have taken no bread. Jesus knowing it said to them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have taken no bread? Do ye not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? How do ye not understand, that I spake not to you concerning bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Saducees? Then they understood, that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Saducees. And Jesus coming into the coasts of Cesarea Philippi, asked his disciples saying, Whom do men say that I am? The Son of man? And they said, Some say, John the Baptist, others Elijah; others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. He saith to them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answering said to him, Happy art thou, Simon Barjonah; for flesh and blood have not revealed this to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I say also to thee, Thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then charged he his disciples, to tell no one, that he was the Christ. From that time Jesus began to shew his disciples, That he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. Then Peter taking hold of him, rebuked him, saying, Favour thyself, Lord: this shall in no wise be unto thee. But he turning said to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me: for thou savourest not the things of God, but the things of men. Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man be willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give, in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then shall he render to every man according to his work. Verily I say to you, there are some standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter and James and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, And was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him. Then answered Peter and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. While he yet spake, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold a voice out of the cloud which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight: hear ye him. And the disciples hearing it, fell on their face and were sore afraid. And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise and be not afraid. And lifting up their eyes, they saw no man, but Jesus only. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen again from the dead. And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes, That Elijah must come first? And Jesus answering said to them, Elijah truly doth come first, and regulate all things. But I say to you, That Elijah is come already, and they acknowledged him not, but have done to him whatever they listed. So shall also the Son of man suffer from them. Then the disciples understood, that he spoke to them of John the Baptist. And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic, and suffereth grievously; for often he falleth into the fire and often into the water. And I brought him to thy disciples, but they could not cure him. Then Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil, and he went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour. Then the disciples coming to Jesus apart said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For verily I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustardseed, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to you. Howbeit this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting. And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men; And they will kill him, and the third day he shall rise again: and they were exceeding sorry. And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the tribute-mony came to Peter and said, Doth not your master pay the tribute? He saith, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? Of their own sons, or of strangers? Peter saith to him, Of strangers. Jesus saith to him, Then are the sons free. Yet that we may not offend them, go to the sea, and cast an hook, and take the fish that first cometh up. And when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money. That take and give them for me and thee. At that time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus calling to him a little child, set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say to you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a milstone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Wo to the world because of offences: for it must needs be that offences come; but wo to that man by whom the offence cometh. Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off and cast them from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the everlasting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire. See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, that in heaven their angels continually behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. What think ye? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them go astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine and go into the mountains, and seek that which is gone astray? And if he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoiceth more over that sheep, than over the ninety and nine which went not astray. So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. But if thy brother shall sin against thee, go and tell him his fault, between thee and him alone: if he will hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear, take with thee one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he will not hear them, tell it to the church; but if he will not hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen and a publican. Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth, touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. Then came Peter to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times? Jesus saith to him, I say not unto thee, till seven times, but till seventy times seven. Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king, who was minded to settle accounts with his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. And as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. Then the servant falling prostrate at his feet, said, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And the lord of that servant, moved with tender compassion, loosed him and forgave him the debt. But that servant going out, found one of his fellow-servants who owed him an hundred pence, and seized him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. And his fellow-servant falling at his feet, besought him saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. But his fellow-servants, seeing what was done, were very sorry, and came and gave their lord an exact account of the whole matter. Then his lord calling him, said to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou intreatedst me. Should'st not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, as I had pity on thee? And his lord being wroth, delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him. So likewise will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. And Jesus, when he had finished these sayings, departed from Gacilee, and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan. And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? And he answering said to them, Have ye not read, that he who made them, made them male and female from the beginning? And said, For this cause a man shall leave father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a writing of divorce and put her away? He saith to them, Because of the hardness of your hearts, Moses suffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you, whosoever shall put away his wife, except for whoredom, and marry another, committeth adultery, and whoso marrieth her that is put away, committeth adultery. His disciples say to him, If the case of a man with his wife be so, it is not expedient to marry. But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs, who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. Then were brought to him little children, that he should lay his hands on them and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of heaven. And he laid his hands on them and departed thence. And behold one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith to him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder: thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; Honour thy father and mother, and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept from my childhood: what lack I yet? Jesus saith to him, If thou desirest to be perfect, go, sell what thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. But the young man, hearing that saying, went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions. Then said Jesus to his disciples, Verily I say to you, a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go thro' the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. His disciples hearing it, were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? But Oesus looking upon them, said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. Then answered Peter and said to him, Behold we have forsaken all, and followed thee. What shall we have therefore? Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, that ye who have followed me, in the renovation, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my names sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and inherit everlasting life. But many first shall be last, and the last shall be first. For the kingdom of heaven is like an housholder, who went out early in the morning, to hire labourers into his vineyard. And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the market-place. And said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I will give you. And they went. Again going out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise. And going out about the eleventh hour, he found others standing idle and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say to him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right ye shall receive. And in the evening the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last to the first. And when they came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every one a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every one a penny. And having received it, they murmured against the housholder, saying, These last have wrought one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day. And he answering said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong. Didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take what is thine, and go: it is my will, to give to this last, even as to thee? Is it not lawful for me, to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many are called, but few chosen. And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said to them, Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, And shall deliver him to the Gentiles, to mock and scourge and crucify him; and the third day he shall rise again. Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshiping him and desiring a certain thing of him. And he said to her, What wilt thou? She saith to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right-hand, and the other on thy left in thy kingdom. But Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink of, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able. And he saith to them, Ye shall indeed drink of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right-hand and on my left is not mine to give, save to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren. But Jesus calling them to him said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. It shall not be so among you; but whosoever desireth to be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever desireth to be chief among you, let him be your servant: Even as the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many. And as they were going from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. And behold two blind men sitting by the way-side, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. And the multitude charged them to hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. And Jesus standing still called them and said, What do ye desire that I should do to you? They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. So Jesus moved with tender compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him. And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, Saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose and bring them to me. And if any man say ought to you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them: and he will send them immediately. This was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek and sitting on an ass, even a colt, the fole of an ass. And the disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them, And brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their clothes and set him thereon: And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut down branches from the trees and strewed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before and that followed after cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David; blessed in the name of the Lord is he that cometh: Hosanna in the highest. And as he came into Jerusalem, all the city was in a commotion, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus, the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee. And Jesus went into the temple, and cast out all that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the mony-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves; And saith to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves. And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. But the chief priests and the scribes, seeing the wonders that he did, and the children crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, were sore displeased, And said to him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith to them, Yea: have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there. Now in the morning, as he was returning to the city he hungered. And seeing a fig-tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only. And he saith to it, Let no fruit grow on thee hence-forward for ever. And presently the fig-tree withered away. And the disciples seeing it marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig-tree withered away? Jesus answering said to them, Verily I say to you, if ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only do this to the fig-tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou lifted up, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority dost thou these things? And who gave thee this authority? And Jesus answering said to them, I will also ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I will likewise tell you, by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven, or of men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, from heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? But if we say, Of men: we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. And they answering said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither tell I you, by what authority I do these things. But what think you? A man had two sons; and coming to the first, he said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. He answering said, I will not; but afterward repenting, he went. And coming to the other, he said likewise. And he answered, I go Sir: but went not. Which of the two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say to you, the publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him. And ye seeing it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. Hear another parable. There was a certain housholder, who planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. And when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it. And the husbandmen taking his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants more than the first; and they did to them likewise. Last of all he sent to them his Son, saying, They will reverence my Son. But the husbandmen seeing the Son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come let us kill him and seize on his inheritance. And taking him, they cast him out of the vineyard and slew him. When therefore the Lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen? They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen who will render him the fruits in their seasons. Jesus saith to them, Have ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, is become the head of the corner? This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. And the chief priests and the Pharisees, hearing his parables, knew he spoke of them. But when they sought to apprehend him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet. And Jesus answering, spake to them again in parables, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a king, who made a marriage-feast for his son. And sent forth his servants to call them that were invited, to the marriage; but they would not come. Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them who were invited, behold I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage. But they slighting it, went one to his farm, another to his merchandise. And the rest laying hold on his servants, treated them shamefully and slew them. And the king hearing it was wroth, and sending forth his troops, destroyed those murderers and burnt their city. Then saith he to his servants, The marriage-feast is prepared, but they who were invited were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and invite whomsoever ye find to the wedding-banquet. So those servants going out into the highways, gathered together all whomsoever they found, both bad and good. And the feast was abundantly supplied with guests. But the king coming in to see the guests, saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment, And saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless. Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few chosen. Then went the Pharisees and consulted, how to insnare him in his talk. And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth; neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not? But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Shew me the tribute-mony. And they brought to him a penny. He saith to them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say to him, Cesar's. Then said he to them, Render therefore to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And hearing it they marvelled. And they left him and went away. The same day came the Saducees, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him, Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother. Now there were with us seven brethren, and the first, having married a wife died, and having no issue, left his wife to his brother. Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. Last of all the woman died also. Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? For they all had her. Jesus answering said to them, Ye err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. But touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not a God of the dead, but of the living. And the multitude hearing it, were astonished at his doctrine. But the Pharisees having heard, that he had silenced the Saducees, were gathered together. And one of them, a scribe, asked him a question, trying him and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, Saying, What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he? They say to him, David's. He saith to them, How doth David then by the Spirit call him Lord? Saying, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my righthand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any from that day question him any more. Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples, saying, The scribes and Pharisees sit in the chair of Moses: All things therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, observe and do; but do not ye after their works; for they say and do not. For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they will not move them with their finger. But all their works they do, to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and inlarge the fringes of their garments. And love the uppermost places at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, And salutations in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi. But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father on earth; for one is your Father, who is in heaven. Neither be ye called Masters; for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. Whosoever shall exalt himself, shall be humbled, and he that shall humble himself, shall be exalted. But wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: ye go not in, neither suffer ye them that are entring to go in. Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye compass sea and land, to make one proselyte, and when he is become so, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. Wo to you, ye blind guides; who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is bound. Ye fools and blind: for which is greater? The gold? Or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? And whosoever shall swear by the altar, ye say, it is nothing: but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, is bound. Ye fools and blind; for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it and by all things thereon. And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein. And he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to have neglected the others. Ye blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel. Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish; but within they are full of rapine and intemperance. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first, the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also. Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye are like whited sepulchres, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness. So ye likewise outwardly appear righteous to men; but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Wo to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchres of the righteous. And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye testify against yourselves, that ye are the sons of them who killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye brood of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? Wherefore behold I send to you prophets, and wise-men, and scribes; and some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city: That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous, to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them who are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a bird gathereth her young under her wings; and ye would not! Behold your house is left unto you desolate. For I say to you, ye shall not see me from this time, till ye say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. And Jesus going out of the temple departed: and his disciples came to him, to shew him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, See ye not all these things? Verily I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down. And as he sat on the mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answering said, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and shall deceive many. And ye will hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled; for all these things must come to pass: but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places: All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to all the world, for a testimony to all nations: and then shall the end come. When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (he that readeth, let him understand;) Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains: Let not him that is on the house-top, come down to take any thing out of his house: Neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes. But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days. And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath. For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not from the beginning of the world to this time, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days shall be shortened. Then if any say to you, Lo here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For false Christs and false prophets shall arise and shew great signs and wonders, so that they would deceive (if it were possible) even the elect. Behold I have told you before. Therefore if they say to you, Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth: Behold he is in the secret chambers, believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even to the west, so shall also the coming of the son of man be. For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light; and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he shall send forth his angels, with a loud-sounding trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. Learn a parable from the fig-tree: when its branch is now tender and shooteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh. So likewise when ye see all these things, know that it is nigh, even at the doors. Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. But of that day and hour knoweth no man, neither the angels of heaven, but my Father only. But as the days of Noah, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were benore the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark. And knew not, till the flood came and took them all away, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Then shall two be in the field: one is taken, and one is left. Two women shall be grinding in the mill; one is taken, and one is left. Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord cometh. But ye know this, that if the housholder had known, in what watch the thief would have come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broke open. Therefore be ye also ready: for at an hour ye think not, the Son of man cometh. Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath appointed ruler over his houshold, to give them food in due season? Happy is that servant, whom his Lord coming shall find so doing. Verily I say to you, he will make him ruler over all his goods. But if that evil servant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming: And shall begin to smite his fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken: The Lord of that servant shall come in a day that he expecteth him not, and in an hour that he is not aware of, And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins, who taking their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom. But five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish, taking their lamps, took not oil with them. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, Behold the bridegroom cometh: come ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. But the wise answered, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage; and the door was shut. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answering said, Verily I say to you, I know you not. Watch therefore; for ye know not the day nor the hour. For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his servants, and delivered to them his goods. And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, according to his own ability, and immediately took his journey. Then he who had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and made them other five talents. And likewise he that had received the two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's mony. After a long time, the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them. And he that had received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Sir, thou deliveredst to me five talents; behold I have gained to them five talents more. His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. He also that had received two talents came and said, Sir, thou deliveredst to me two talents; behold I have gained to them two other talents. His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things: I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Then he that had received the one talent came and said, Sir, I knew that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hadst not sown, and gathering whence thou hadst not scattered. And being afraid, I went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast what is thine. His lord answering said to him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather whence I had not scattered? Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with interest. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it him who hath ten talents. For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, shall be taken away even what he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory. And all nations shall be gathered before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats. And he will set the sheep on his right-hand, and the goats on the left. Then shall the king say to them on his right-hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in; Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick or in prison, and came to thee? And the king shall answer and say to them, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it to me. Then shall he say also to them on his left-hand, Depart from me, ye cursed into the everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not micister to thee? Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it oot to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life everlasting. And when Jesus had finished all these discourses, he said to his disciples, Ye know that after two days is the Passoever, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. Then the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled together, at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas. And consulted, how they might apprehend Jesus by subtlety and kill him. But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be a tumult among the people. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came to him a woman; having an alabaster box of very costly ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at table. But his disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. Jesus knowing it, said to them, Why trouble ye the woman? She hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in pouring this ointment on my body, she hath done it for my burial. Verily I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, this also which she hath done shall be spoken for a memorial of her. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, going to the chief priests, Said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they bargained with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. On tbe first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master saith, My time is at hand: I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. When the evening was come, he sat down with the twelve. And as they ate he said, Verily I say to you, One of you will betray me. And they were exceeding sorrowful and began each of them to say to him, Lord, Is it I? And he answering said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me. The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man if he had not been born. Then Judas who betrayed him answering said, Master, Is it I? He saith to him, Thou hast said. And after they had eaten, Jesus took bread and blessed and brake and gave it to his disciples and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it. For this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many, for the remission of sins. I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till the day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. And when they had sung the hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. Then saith Jesus to them, All ye will be offended at me this night, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered. But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. Peter answering said to him, Tho' all should be offended at thee, I will never be offended. Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, before cock-crowing thou wilt deny me thrice. Peter saith to him, If I must die with thee, yet will I in no wise deny thee. In like manner also said all the disciples. Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and in deep anguish. Then saith he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. And going a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou wilt. And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, What! Could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing; but the flesh is weak. Again the second time he went away and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup cannot pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done. And he came and found them asleep again; for their eyes were weighed down. And leaving them, he went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. Then cometh he to his disciples and saith to them, Sleep on now and take your rest: Behold the hour is come, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise; let us be going: behold he that betrayeth me is at hand. And while he was yet speaking, lo Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people. Now he that betrayed him, had given them a signal, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, is he; seize him. And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said, Hail, Master, and kissed him. And Jesus said to him, Friend, Wherefore art thou come? Then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him. And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching out his hand, drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear. Then said Jesus to him, Put up again thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword, shall perish by the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now ask my Father, and he will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? In that hour Jesus said to the multitude, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye took me not. But all this is done, that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled. And they that had apprehended Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest's palace, and going in, sat with the officers, to see the end. Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death, But found none; yea, tho' many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At last came two false witnesses, And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. And the high priest rising up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee? But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, to tell us, if thou art the Christ, the Son of God? Jesus saith to him, Thou hast said. Moreover I say to you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right-hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? Behold now ye have heard his blasphemy. What think ye? They answering said, He is guilty of death. Then did they spit in his face and buffet him, and others smote him, Saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee? Now Peter sat without in the hall. And one of the maid-servants came to him saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. But he denied before all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth. And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man. And after a while they that stood by, came and said to Peter, Surely thou art also one of them; for thy speech discovereth thee. Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said to him, Before cock-crowing thou wilt deny me thrice. And he went out and wept bitterly. When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, to put him to death. And having bound him, they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governour. Then Judas who had betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned, in betraying innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? See thou to it. And having thrown down the pieces of silver in the temple, he withdrew and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests taking the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And having consulted together, they bought with them the potters field, to bury foreigners in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood unto this day. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value, And gave them for the potters field, as the Lord commanded me. And Jesus stood before the governour. And the governour questioned him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest. And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. Then said Pilate to him, Hearest thou not, how many things they witness against thee? And he answered him to never a word, so that the governour marvelled greatly. Now at the feast the governour was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would. And they had then a notorious prisoner, named Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ? For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. While he sat on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things to-day in a dream because of him. But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude, to ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. The governour answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release to you? They say, Barabbas. Pilate saith to them, What shall I do then with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified. And the governour said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. Then Pilate, seeing, that he could prevail nothing, but rather a tumult was made, took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man: see ye to it. Then all the people answering said, His blood be on us and on our children. Then released he Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governour, taking Jesus into the common hall, gathered to him the whole troop. And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe, And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a cane in his right-hand; and kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews. And spitting on him, they took the cane and smote him on the head. And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. And coming out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. And coming to a place called Golgotha, that is, the place of a skull, They gave him vinegar mingled with gall to drink, and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. And they crucified him and parted his garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots. And sitting down, they guarded him there, And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then were two thieves crucified with him, one on the right-hand and one on the left. And they that were passing by reviled him, wagging their heads and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son God, come down from the cross. In like manner the chief priests also with the scribes and elders mocking him said, He saved others; Cannot he save himself? If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God: let him deliver him now if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God. And even the robbers that were crucified with him, cast the same reproach upon him. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth, unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama-sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood there hearing it, said, He calleth Elijah. And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge filled it with vinegar, and put it on a cane, and gave him to drink. The rest said, Let be: let us see whether Elijah will come to save him. Jesus after he had cried again with a loud voice, dismissed his spirit. And behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken and the rocks were torn asunder: And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of holy men that slept were raised. And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, went into the holy city, and appeared to many. And the centurion and they that were with him, guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that were done, feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. And many women were there, beholding afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him. Among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children. When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus. He going to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus: then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it in clean linen, And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, departed. And Mary Magdalene was there and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate, Saying, Sir, we remember, that impostor said while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured till the third day, lest his disciples coming steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last imposture shall be worse than the first. Pilate said to them, Ye have a guard; go, make it as secure as ye can. So they went and secured the sepulchre, sealing the stone, and setting a guard. Now after the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And behold, there had been a great earthquake, and an angel of the Lord descending from heaven, had come and rolled away the stone from the door and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled, and became as dead men. But the angel answering said to the women, Fear not ye; for I know ye seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for he is risen, as he said: come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly and tell the disciples, that he is risen from the dead. And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him. Lo, I have told you. And departing quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy they ran to tell his disciples. And behold Jesus met them and said, Hail. And they came, and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. Then saith Jesus to them, Fear not. Go tell my brethren to go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. While they were going, behold some of the guard coming into the city, told the chief priests all the things that had been done. And having met together with the elders and taken counsel, they gave large mony to the soldiers, Saying, Say his disciples came by night, and stole him while we slept. And if this come to the governour's ears, we will persuade him and secure you. So they took the money and did as they were taught; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews till this day. Then the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him they worshiped him, tho' some had doubted. And Jesus came and spake to them, saying, All power is given me in heaven and in earth. Go ye and disciple all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the world.The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God: As it is written in the prophets, Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee. The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. John baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins. And there went out to him all the land of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. And John was clothed with camels hair, and with a leathern girdle about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey, And proclaimed, saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. I indeed have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost. And in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John at Jordan. And coming up from the water, straitway he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. And a voice came from heaven, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I delight. And immediately the Spirit leadeth him out into the wilderness. And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild-beasts; and the angels served him. Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, Saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers) And Jesus said to them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men. And straightway leaving their nets, they followed him. And having gone thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were also in the vessel, mending their nets: And he called them; and immediately leaving their father Zebedee in the vessel with the hired servants, they went after him. And they go into Capernaum. And straightway on the sabbath, he went into the synagogue and taught. And they were astonished at his teaching; for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. And there was in their synagogue a man heaving an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying, Let us alone: what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy one of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him. And the unclean spirit having torn him, and cried with a loud noise, came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? What new teaching is this? For with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits and they obey him. And immediately his fame went forth into all the country of Galilee round about. And coming out of the synagogue, they entered forthwith into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. And Simon's wife's mother lay ill of a fever, and immediately they tell him of her. And he came and taking her by the hand, lifted her up; and straightway the fever left her, and she waited on them. And in the evening, when the sun was set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. And the whole city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many that were ill of divers diseases, and cast out many devils, and suffered not the devils to say that they knew him. And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out and departed into a desert place and prayed there. And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. And having found him, they say to him, All men seek thee. And he saith to them, Let us go to the neighbouring towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore am I come. And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. And there came to him a leper beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus, moved with tender compassion, putting forth his hand, touched him, and saith to him, I will; be thou clean. And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed. And having straitly charged him, he forthwith sent him away, And saith to him, See thou say nothing to any man; but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. But he going out published it much and blazed abroad the matter, so that he could no more openly enter into the city; but he was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter. And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was heard that he was in the house. And immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no room for them, no, not even about the door. And he spake the word to them. And they come to him, bringing a paralytic, borne of four. And not being able to come nigh him for the croud, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having broken it up, they let down the couch whereon the paralytic lay. Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee. But certain of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God only? And Jesus immediately knowing in his spirit, that they so reasoned in themselves, said to them, Why reason ye thus in your hearts? Which is easier? To say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven thee? Or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk? But that ye may know, that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins: (He saith to the paralytic) I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go to thine house. And immediately he arose, and taking up his couch, went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus. And he went forth again by the sea-side, and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them. And passing by, he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus sitting at the custom-house, and saith to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. And as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him. And the scribes and Pharisees seeing him eat with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? And Jesus hearing it saith to them- They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and then shall they fast in those days. No man seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filleth it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. And no man putteth new wine into old leathern-bottles; else the new wine bursteth the bottles, and the wine is spilt, and the bottles are lost; but new wine must be put into new bottles. And he went thro' the corn-fields on the sabbath day: and his disciples as they went, plucked the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful? And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry he and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave also to them who were with him? And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath. Moreover the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. And he entered again into the synagogue: and there was a man there who had a withered hand. And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him. And he saith to the man that had the withered hand, Stand forth. And he saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? To save life or to kill? But they held their peace. And looking round upon them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored. And the Pharisees going out, straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. Then Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, And from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what great things he did, came to him. And he spake to his disciples, that a boat should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. For he had healed many, so that they rushed in upon him, as many as had plagues. And unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. And he straitly charged them, not to make him known. And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth to him whom he would, and they came to him. And he ordained twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, And to have power to heal diseases and to cast out devils. And Simon he surnamed Peter: And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (and he surnamed them Boanerges, that is, the sons of thunder) And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite, And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And they come into an house: And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. And his relations hearing of it, came out to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself. But the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. And calling them to him, he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if an house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. If Satan then be risen up and divided against himself, he cannot stand, but hath an end. None can enter into the strong one's house and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong one, and then he will plunder his house. Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven the sons of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme. But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is liable to eternal damnation: Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. Then come his brethren and his mother, and standing without, sent to him, calling him. And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren? And looking round on them who sat about him, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren. For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother and sister and mother. And again he taught by the sea-side, and a great multitude was gathered to him, so that going into the boat, he sat in the sea, and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching, Hearken: Behold, a sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and the birds of the air came and devoured it. And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprung up, because it had no depth of earth. But when the sun was up, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. And other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit springing up and increasing, and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. And he said, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. And when he was alone, they that were about him, with the twelve, asked him of the parable. And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are in parables: So that seeing they see, and do not perceive, and hearing they hear, and do not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. And he saith to them, Know ye not this parable? How then will ye know all parables? The sower soweth the word. And these are they by the way-side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word sown in their hearts. And these are they likewise who have received the seed on stony ground, who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy: But have not root in themselves, and so indure but for a time: afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth because of the word, they are presently offended. And these are they that have received it among thorns, who hear the word, And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. And these are they that have received it on the good ground, who hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty fold, some sixty, and some an hundred. And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be cut under a bushel or under a bed, and not to be set on a candlestick? For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested, neither was any thing kept secret, but that it might come abroad. If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear. And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you, and to you that hear, shall more be given. For he that hath, to him shall be given; but he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground, And should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, after that, the full corn in the ear. But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. And he said, Whereto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what comparison shall we compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which when it is sown in the earth, is one of the least of the seeds that are in the earth. But when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs, so that the birds of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. And with many such parables spake he the word to them, as they were able to hear. But without a parable spake he not to them: and in private he expounded all things to his disciples. And the same day, in the evening he saith to them, Let us go over to the other side. And having sent away the multitude, they take him as he was in the boat. And there were with him other little vessels. And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full. But he was asleep on the pillow, in the stern of the boat. And they awake him and say to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? And he arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace; be still. And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. And he said to them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it, that ye have not faith? And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. And as he came out of the boat, there met him immediately out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, Who had his dwelling among the tombs, and no man could bind him, no not with chains. For he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder, by him, and the fetters broken in pieces; and no man could tame him. And always night and day, he was in the tombs, and in the mountains, crying and cutting himself with stones. But seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped him, And crying with a loud voice, said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.(For he had said to him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.) And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered saying, My name is Legion; for we are many. And he earnestly besought him, that he would not send them away out of the country. Now there was there at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding. And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us to the swine, that we may go into them. And Jesus forthwith gave them leave. And the unclean spirits going out, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea. And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see that which was done. And they come to Jesus and see the demoniac, sitting and clothed and in his right mind: and they were afraid. And they saw it told them how it befell that demoniac, and also concerning the swine. And they prayed him to depart out of their coasts. And as he went into the boat, he that had been possessed with the devils, besought him, that he might be with him. But Jesus suffered him not, but said to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. And he departed and published in Decapolis, how great things Jesus had done for him. And all men marvelled. And when Jesus was passed over again by boat to the other side, much people was gathered to him, and he was near the sea. And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, falleth at his feet. And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed, and she shall live. And he went with him, and much people followed him and thronged him. And a certain woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years, And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grown worse, Having heard of Jesus, came in the croud behind, and touched his garment. For she said, If I but touch his clothes, I shall be whole. And the fountain of her blood was straightway dried up, and she knew in her body, that she was healed of that plague. And Jesus immediately knowing in himself, that virtue had gone out of him, turning about in the croud said, Who touched my clothes? And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? And he looked round to see her that had done this. And the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole: go in peace, and continue whole of thy plague. While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master farther? When Jesus heard the word spoken he saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; only believe. And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth a tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. And coming in, he saith to them, Why make ye this ado and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. But having put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and goeth in where the damsel was lying. And taking the damsel by the hand he said to her, Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted, Damsel, (I say to thee) arise. And straightway the damsel arose and walked: for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. And he charged them straitly, that no man should know it, and commanded that something should be given her to eat. And he went out from thence and came into his own country, and his disciples follow him. And on the sabbath he taught in the synagogue, and many hearing were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? And what wisdom is this that is given him, that such mighty works are wrought by his hands? Is not this the carpenter? The son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and of Judas and Simon! And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house. And he could do no miracle there, save that he laid his hands on a few sick and healed them. And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about thro' the villages teaching. And he calleth to him the twelve, and sent them forth by two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits; And commanded them to take nothing for the journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no mony in their purse; But be shod with sandals, and not to put on two coats. And he said to them, Wheresoever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place. And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you, departing thence shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city. And they went out and preached, that men should repent. And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them. And king Herod heard (for his name was spread abroad) and he said, John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore divine powers exert themselves in him. Others said, It is Elijah: and others said, It is a prophet, as one of the prophets. But Herod hearing thereof, said, This is that John whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead. For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him in prison, for Herodias sake, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her. For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee, to have thy brother's wife. Therefore Herodias was incensed against him, and was desirous to have killed him; but she could not. For Herod reverenced John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and preserved him: and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. And a convenient day being come, when Herod on his birth-day made a feast, for his lords, captains, and principal men of Galilee: When the daughter of Herodias had come in and danced and pleased Herod, and his guests, the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. And he sware to her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask me, I will give thee, to the half my kingdom. And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. And coming in quickly with haste to the king she asked, saying, I will that thou give me immediately in a charger the head of John the Baptist. And the king was exceeding sorry: yet for his oath's sake, and for the sake of his guests, he would not reject her. And immediately the king sent one of his guard, and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison, And brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother. And the disciples hearing it, came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb. And the apostles gather themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. And they departed into a desert place by boat privately. And many saw them departing and knew him, and ran a foot thither from all the cities, and outwent them, and came together to him. And Jesus coming out saw a great multitude, and was moved with tender compassion for them; because they were as sheep having no shepherd, and he taught them many things. And when the day was now far spent, the disciples coming to him said, This is a desert place, and it is now late. Send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat. He answered and said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? He saith to them, How many loaves have you? Go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fishes. And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies on the green grass. And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties. And taking the five loaves, and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed, and gave them to the disciples to set before them: and he divided the two fishes among them all. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes. And they that had eaten of the loaves, were about five thousand men. And straightway he constrained his disciples to go into the boat, and go before to the other side toward Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. And having sent them away, he went to a mountain to pray. And in the evening, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed by them. But they seeing him walking on the sea, supposed it had been an apparition, and cried out.(For they all saw him and were troubled.) And immediately he talked with them, and saith to them, Take courage: it is I: be not afraid. And he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased: and they were amazed in themselves above measure and wondered. For they considered not the miracle of the loaves; for their heart was hardened. And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and drew to shore. And when they were come out of the boat, they knew him, And ran thro' the whole country round about, and brought about in beds them that were ill, where they heard he was. And wheresoever he entered into villages, cities, or country-places, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the hem of his garment; and as many as touched him were made whole. Then come together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem. And they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, unwashen hands. Now the Pharisees and all the Jews, except they wash their hands to the wrist, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. And coming from the market, unless they wash, they eat not: and many other things there are which they have received to hold, the washings of cups and pots and brasen vessels and couches. Then the Pharisees ask him, Why walk not thy disciples, according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with defiled hands? He answering said to them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. For leaving the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. And he said to them, Full well ye abolish the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother, and, Whoso revileth father or mother, he shall surely die. But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest have been profited by me: he shall be free. And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother; Abrogating the word of God by your traditions which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do. And calling all the multitude, he said to them, Hearken to me every one of you and consider. There is nothing entering into a man from without, which can defile him; but the things which come out of him, these are they that defile the man. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. And when he was come from the multitude into the house, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. And he saith to them, Are even ye so without understanding? Do ye not perceive, That whatsoever entereth into a man from without, cannot defile him, Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth into the vault, purging all meats. And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. For from within, out of the heart of man proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, envy, evil speaking, pride, foolishness. All these evils come from within, and defile the man. And he arose and went thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And entring into an house, he would have had no man know it; but he could not be hid. For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell at his feet, (The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation) and besought him to cast the devil out of her daughter. But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be satisfied; for it is not right to take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs. She answered and said to him, True, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. And he said to her, For this saying, go: the devil is gone out of thy daughter. And going to her house, she found the devil gone out and her daughter lying on the bed. And departing again from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, thro' the midst of the country of Decapolis. And they bring to him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and beseech him to put his hand upon him. And taking him aside from the multitude, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, touched his tongue. And looking up to heaven, he groaned and saith to him, Ephphatha, that is, be opened. And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. And he charged them to tell no man; but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it, And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak. In those days, the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus calling his disciples saith to them, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat. And if I send them away fasting to their own home, they will faint by the way; for divers of them come from far. And his disciples answered him, Whence can one satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness? And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, having given thanks, he brake and gave to his disciples to set before them: and they did set them before the people. And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded, to set them also before them. So they did eat and were satisfied; and they took up of the fragments that were left, seven baskets. And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. And straightway going into the boat with his disciples he came into the parts of Dalmanutha. And the Pharisees came forth and questioned with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, Why doth this generation seek a sign? Verily I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation. And he left them and taking boat again, went to the other side. Now they had forgotten to take bread; nor had they in the boat with them any more than one loaf. And he charged them, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We have no bread. And Jesus knowing it saith to them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? Perceive ye not yet, neither consider? Have ye your heart yet hardened? Having eyes, see ye not? And having ears, hear ye not? And do not ye remember? When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve. And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. And he said to them, How is it, that ye do not understand? And he cometh to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him. And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town, and having spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him, If he saw ought? And looking up he said, I see men, as trees walking. Then he put his hands again on his eyes and made him look up, and he was restored and saw all men clearly. And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town. And Jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of Cesarea Philippi. And in the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Whom do men say that I am? And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say Elijah; and others, one of the prophets. And he saith to them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answering saith to him, Thou art the Christ. And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. And he spake that saying openly. And Peter taking hold of him, rebuked him. But he turning about, and looking on his disciples rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou savourest not the things of God, but the things of men. And when he had called the people to him, with his disciples also, he said to them, Whosoever is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life, for my sake and the gospels, he shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give, in exchange for his soul? For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels. And he said to them, Verily I say unto you, there are some of them that stand here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God coming with power. And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and carrieth them up into an high mountain, by themselves apart, and was transfigured before them. And his raiment became shining, exceeding white, as snow, such as no fuller on earth can whiten. And there appeared to him Elijah with Moses, and they talked with Jesus. And Peter answering faith to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. For he knew not what to say; for they were sore afraid. And there was a cloud that overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son; hear him. And suddenly looking round, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves. And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them to tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. And they laid hold on that saying, questioning one with another, What meaneth, Till he were risen from the dead? And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes, that Elijah must come first? And he answering told them, Elijah verily coming first, restoreth all things: and, how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at naught. But I say to you, Elijah is come, as it is written of him: and they have done to him whatsoever they listed. And coming to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them. And straightway all the multitude seeing him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, saluted him. And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? And one of the multitude answering said, Master, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit. And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away. And I spake to thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not. He answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him to me. And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him, and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. And he asked his father, How long is it since this came to him? And he said, From a little child. And it hath often cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him; but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us and help us. Jesus saith to him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child crying out, said with tears, Lord, I do believe: help thou mine unbelief. And Jesus seeing that the multitude came running together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying, Thou deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. And having cried and rent him sore, he came out; and he was as dead, so that many said, He is dead. But Jesus taking him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose. And when he was come into an house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out? And he said to them, This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting. And departing thence, they passed thro' Galilee, and he was not willing that any should know it. For he taught his disciples and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men; and they will kill him, and after he hath been killed, he shall rise the third day. But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him. And he came to Capernaum. And being in the house, he asked them, What was it ye disputed among yourselves by the way? But they held their peace; for they had been debating among themselves in the way, Who should be greatest? And sitting down, he called the twelve and saith to them, If any man desire to be first, let him be the last of all, and the servant of all. And taking a little child, he set him in the midst of them, and embracing him he said to them, Whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not only me, but him that sent me. And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, who followeth not us, and we forbad him, because he followeth not us. And Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, who can readily speak evil of me. For he that is not against you, is for you. For whosoever shall give you a cup of cold water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. And whosoever shall offend one of the little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is good for thee, to enter into the kingdom of God having one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. And he arose and cometh thence into the coasts of Judea, thro' the country beyond Jordan: and the multitudes resort to him again, and as he was wont, he taught them again. And the Pharisees coming asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? Tempting him. And he answering said to them, What did Moses command you? They said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away. And Jesus answering said to them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this precept. But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife: And they twain shall be one flesh; so then they are no more twain but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter. And he saith to them, Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery. And they brought little children to him that he might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those that brought them. But Jesus seeing it was much displeased and said to them, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein. And taking them up in his arms, he put his hands upon them and blessed them. And as he was going out into the way, one running and kneeling to him, asked him, Good Master, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life? But Jesus saith to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. And he answering said to him, Master, all these have I kept from my childhood. Then Jesus looking upon him, loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lackest: Go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me, taking up thy cross. But he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved; for he had great possessions. And Jesus looking round said to his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God? And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answering again saith to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God? It is easier for a camel to go thro' the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. And they were astonished out of measure, saying to each other, Who then can be saved? And Jesus looking upon them said, With men it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are possible. And Peter said to him, Lo, we have left all and followed thee. And Jesus answering said, Verily I say to you, there is none that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my sake and the gospel's, But he shall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions, and in the world to come eternal life. But many that are first shall be last, and the last first. And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them. And they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he told them what things should befall him: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes: and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles. And they will mock him and scourge him and spit upon him and kill him. And the third day he will rise again. And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us what we shall ask. And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you? They said to him, Grant us to sit one on thy right-hand, and one on thy left-hand in thy glory. But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with. But to sit on my right-hand and on my left, is not mine to give, but to them for whom it is prepared. And the ten hearing it, were much displeased with James and John. But Jesus calling them, saith to them, Ye know that they who rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever desireth to be great among you, shall be your servant. And whosoever desireth to be the chief, shall be the servant of all. For the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many. And they come to Jericho. And as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the way-side begging. And when he heard, It is Jesus of Nazareth, he cried out and said, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And many charged him to hold his peace; but he cried so much the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus standing still, commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Take courage; rise; he calleth thee. And casting away his garment, he rose and came to Jesus. And Jesus answering said to him, What wilt thou that I should do for thee? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said, Go; thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way. And when they were come nigh to Jerusalem to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples, And saith to them, Go ye into the village over against you, and as soon as ye enter it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat: loose and bring him. And if any say to you, Why do ye this? Say, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. And they went and found the colt tied, without, in the street, and they loose him. And some of them that stood there said, What do ye, loosing the colt? And they said to them, as Jesus had commanded; and they let them go. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him, and he sat on him. And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way. And they that went before, and they that followed after cried, saying, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh: Hosanna in the highest. And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple, and having looked round about upon all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. And on the morrow, as they were coming from Bethany, he was hungry. And seeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and coming to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not a season of figs. And he answering said to it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever: And his disciples heard it. And they come to Jerusalem. And Jesus going into the temple, drove out them that bought and sold in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the mony-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And suffered not that any one should carry any vessel thro' the temple. And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations an house of prayer? But ye have made it a den of thieves. And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his teaching. And when evening was come, he went out of the city. And passing by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots. And Peter remembring, saith to him, Master, behold the fig-tree which thou cursedst is withered away. And Jesus answering saith to them, Have faith in God. For verily I say to you, Whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and cast into the sea, and not doubt in his heart, but believe that the things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say to you, What things soever ye ask in prayer, believe that ye shall receive, and ye shall have them. But when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any, that your Father who is in heaven, may forgive you also your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses. And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders come to him and say to him, By what authority dost thou these things? And who gave thee authority to do these things? Jesus answering said to them, I also will ask you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. Was the baptism of John of heaven or of men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, from heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? But if we say, of men: they feared the people; for all accounted John, that he was indeed a prophet. And they answering say to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith to them, Neither tell I you, by what authority I do these things. And he said to them in parables, A man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a wine-fat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, to receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. But they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. And again he sent to them another servant: and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled. And again he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, beating some and killing some. Having yet therefore one son his well-beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will reverence my son. But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. And they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And have ye not read this scripture? The stone which the builders rejected, is become the head of the corner? This was the Lord's doing, and it was marvellous in our eyes. And they sought to seize him, but feared the multitude; for they knew he had spoken the parable against them; and leaving him, they went away. And they send to him certain of the Pharisees, and of the Herodians, to catch him his talk. And they coming say to him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me a penny, that I may see it. And he saith, Whose is this image and superscription? They say to him, Cesar's. And Jesus answering said to them, Render to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him. Then come to him the Saducees, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him, saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. There were seven brethren, and the first took a wife, and dying, left no seed. And the second took her and died, neither left he any seed; and the third likewise. And the seventh took her and left no seed. Last of all died the woman also. In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her to wife. And Jesus answering said to them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels who are in heaven. And touching the dead, that they rise, Have ye oot read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake to thim, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. Ye therefore greatly err. And one of the scribes came, and having heard them disputing together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these. And the scribe said to him, Excellently well, Master! Thou hast said the truth: for He is one: and there is no other but he. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the mind, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices. And Jesus, seeing that he answered discreetly, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst question him any more. And Jesus answering, as he taught in the temple, said, How say the scribes, that Christ is the Son of David? For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord saith to my Lord, Sit thou on my righthand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. David therefore himself calleth him Lord: How is he then his son? And a great multitude heard him gladly. And he said to them in his teaching, Beware of the Scribes, who love to go in long sobes, and to be saluted in the market-places, And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts: Who devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive the greater damnation. And Jesus sitting over-against the treasury, beheld how the people cast mony into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. And a poor widow coming, cast in two mites, which make a farthing. And calling his disciples, he saith to them, Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all who have cast into the treasury. For they all did cast in of their abundance: but she of her penury did cast in all that she had, even her whole living. And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to him, Master, see what manner of stones, and what manner of buildings! And Jesus answering said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. And as he sat on the mount of Olives, over-against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled? And Jesus answering said, Take heed lest any deceive you. For many will come in my name saying, I am Christ, and will deceive many. But when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be not troubled; for it must be; but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginning of sorrows. But take heed to yourselves for they will deliver you to councils, and ye shall be beaten in synagogues, and shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them. And the gospel must first be published among all nations. But when they shall hale you and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak; for it is not yet that speak, but the Holy Ghost. Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son: and children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake; but he that endureth to the end, he shall be saved. But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand) then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains: And let not him that is on the house-top go down into the house, neither enter in, to take any thing out of his house. And let not him that is in the field, turn back to take up his garment. But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days. And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creat`on, which God created until now, neither shall be. And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened those days. Then if any man say to you, Lo, here is Christ, or lo, he is there, believe it not. For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with power and great glory. And then shall he send his angels, and gather together his elect, from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth, to the uttermost part of heaven. Now learn a parable from the fig-tree. When its branch is now tender and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near. So likewise when ye see these things come to pass, know that he is nigh, even at the door. Verily I say to you, this generation shall in no wise pass, till all these things be done. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away. But of that day and hour knoweth no one, no, not the angels that are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take heed; watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to each his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore; for ye know not when the master of the house cometh; at evening, or at midnight, or at cock-crowing, or in the morning: Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch. And after two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might apprehend him by subtlety, and put him to death. But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be a tumult of the people. And he being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment, of spikenard, very costly; and shaking the box, she poured it on his head. But there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and given to the poor. And they murmured at her. But Jesus said, Let her alone: why trouble ye her? She hath wrought a good work on me. For ye have the poor always with you, and when ye will, ye may do them good; but me ye have not always. She hath done what she could: she hath before-hand embalmed my body for the burial. Verily I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, what she hath done shall be spoken of also, for a memorial of her. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him unto them. And hearing it they were glad, and promised to give him mony. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayst eat the passover? And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him. And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the man of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples? And he will shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready for us. And his disciples went, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them. And they made ready the passover. And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. And as they sat and ate, Jesus said, Verily I say to you, one of you that eat with me will betray me. And they were sorry, and said to him one by one, Is it I? And another, Is it I? And he answering said to them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish. The Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him; but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man, if he had not been born. And as they ate, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup, and having given thanks, gave it them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, This is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many. Verily I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, till that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. And having sung the hymn, they went out toward the mount of Olives. And Jesus saith to them, Ye all will be offended at me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. But Peter said to him, Tho' all men shall be offended, yet will not I. Jesus saith to him, Verily I say to thee, That thou to-day, this night, before the cock crow twice, wilt deny me thrice. But he said the more vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. In like manner also said they all. And they come to a place named Gethsemane; and he saith to his disciples, Sit here while I shall pray. And he taketh with him Peter and James and John; and he began to be sore amazed and in deep anguish, And saith to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death; tarry ye here and watch. And going forward a little, he fell on the ground, and prayed, that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: take away this cup from me: yet not what I will, but what thou wilt. And he cometh and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Couldest thou not watch one hour? Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. And going again he prayed, speaking the same words. And returning, he found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy) and they knew not what to answer him. And he cometh the third time and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour is come: behold the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise up; let us go: lo he that betrayeth me is at hand. And immediately, while ye yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders. Now he that betrayed him had given them a signal, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, is he: seize and lead him away safely. And when he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, Master! And kissed him? And they laid their hands on him, and took him. And one of them that stood by, drew a sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. And Jesus answering said to them, Are ye come as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not; but the scriptures must be fulfilled. Then they all forsook him and fled. And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him. And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and with him were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders and scribes. And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest, and sat with the officers, and warmed himself. Then the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus, to put him to death, and found none. For many bore false witness against him; but their evidences were not sufficient. And there arose certain, and bore false witness against him, saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands. And neither so was their evidence sufficient. Then the high priest standing up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? What is it which these witness against thee? But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man, sitting on the right-hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest rent his clothes and saith, What farther need have we of witnesses? Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to deserve death. And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy, And the officers smote him with the palms of their hands. And as Peter was in the hall below, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest. And seeing Peter warming himself, she looked on him and said, Thou wast also with Jesus of Nazareth. But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou meanest. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew. And the maid saw him again, and said to them that stood by, This is one of them. And he denied it again. And a little after, those that stood by, said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto. Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak. And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. And he covered his head and wept. And straightway in the morning the chief priests consulted with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, and having bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. And Pilate asked him, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering said to him, Thou sayst it. And the chief priests accused him of many things; but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? Behold how many things they witness against thee. But Jesus answered nothing any more, so that Pilate marvelled. Now at every feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they would. And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. And the multitude crying aloud, desired him to do as he had ever done for them. And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the king of the Jews?(For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy) But the chief priests stirred up the people to desire, that he would rather release Barabbas to them. And Pilate answering said to them again, What will ye then that I do to him whom ye call the king of the Jews? And they cried out again, Crucify him. Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. And Pilate, willing to satisfy the people, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Pretorium, and call together the whole troop. And they clothe him with purple, and having platted a crown of thorns, put it about his head. And they saluted him, Hail, king of the Jews. And they smote him on the oead with a cane, and spit upon him, and bowing their knees, did him homage. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who was passing by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. And they bring him to the place, Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a skull. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he received it not. And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. And it was the third hour, when they crucified him. And there was an inscription of his written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. And with him they crucify two thieves, one on his right-hand, and one on his left. And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. And they that passed by, reviled him, wagging their heads and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, Save thyself, and come down from the cross. In like manner also the chief priests mocking said one to another, with the scribes, He saved others; cannot he save himself? Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. They also that were crucified with him reviled him. And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And one of them that stood by, hearing it said, Behold, he calleth Elijah. And one ran and filling a sponge with vinegar, put it on a cane, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take him down. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and expired. And the veil of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom. And the centurion, who stood over-against him, seeing that having so cried he expired, said, Truly this man was the Son of God. There were also women, beholding from afar, among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome: Who also when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered to him, and many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem. And the evening being now come, (because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath) Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. And Pilate marvelled that he was dead already: and calling to him the centurion, he asked, If he had been any while dead? And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. And having bought fine linen, he took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre, which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, beheld where he was laid. And when the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Salome, had bought spices, that they might come and embalm him. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun. And they said one to another, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?(For it was very great:) And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled away. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man, sitting on the right-side, clothed in a white robe; and they were affrighted. He saith to them, Be not affrighted: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen: he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples, and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you. And going out, they fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: and they said nothing to any; for they were afraid. Now when Jesus was risen early, the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. But they, hearing that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not. After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they were walking, going into the country. And they went and told it to the rest, neither believed they them. Afterwards he appeared to the eleven, sitting at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them who had seen him after he was risen. And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe: in my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues: They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them: they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. So then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat on the right-hand of God. And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.Forasmuch as many have undertaken to compose a narrative of the facts which have been fully confirmed among us, Even as they who were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word from the beginning, delivered them to us: It seemed good to me also, having accurately traced all things from their first rise, to write unto thee in order, most noble Theophilus, That thou mayst know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years. And while he executed the priest's office before God, in the order of his course, According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn the incense, going into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zacharias seeing him was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. And thou shalt have joy and exultation, and many shall rejoice at his birth. For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. And Zacharias said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife advanced in years. And the angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. And behold, thou shalt be deaf, and not able to speak, till the day that these things are done, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. And coming out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived, that he had seen a vision; for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless. And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he went to his own house. And after these days, his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord done to me, in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, To a virgin of the house of David, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, and the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel coming in to her, said, Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. But she seeing him, was troubled at his saying, and reasoned, what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob; for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answering said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born, shall be called the Son of God. And behold thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God, nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the hill-country, into a city of Judah , And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. And when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost, And cried with a loud voice and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For lo! when the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. And happy is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name. And his mercy is on them that fear him, from generation to generation. He hath wrought strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things, but sent the rich empty away. He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy, As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever. And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house. Now Elisabeth's full time came, that she should be delivered, and she brought forth a son. And her neighbours and relations heard, that the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. But his mother answering said, Nay, but he shall be called John. And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called. And asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, praising God. And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these things were noised abroad, in all the hill-country of Judea. And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, in the house of his servant David: As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began: That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant, The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, That he would grant us, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, to serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. And thou, child, shalt be a prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways, To give knowledge of salvation to his people, by the remission of their sins, Thro' the tender mercy of our God, whereby the Day-spring from on high hath visited us, To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the day of his being shewn to Israel. And in those days there went out a decree from Augustus Cesar, that all the world should be inrolled.(Now this first inrolment was made, when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be inrolled, every one to his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,(because he was of the family and houshold of David) To be inrolled with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child. And while they were there, the days were fulfilled, that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her son, the first-born, and swathed him, and laid him in the manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds, lying out in the field, and keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo an angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid. And the angel said to them, Fear not; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For to you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign to you; ye shall find the babe, wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace; goodwill toward men. And when the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is done, which the Lord hath made known to us. And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in the manger. And having seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all that heard wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, comparing them together in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them. And when eight days were fulfilled, to circumcise the child, his name was called Jesus, which was named of the angel, before he was conceived in the womb. And when the days of purification were fulfilled according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord:(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be holy to the Lord) And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons. And behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and religious, waiting for the Consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by the spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the Law, He took him up in his arms, and blessed God and said, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For mine eyes have seen thy salvation: Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people. A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against,(Yea, and a sword shall pierce thro' thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity. And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers, night and day. And she coming in at that hour, gave thanks to the Lord, and spake of him to all that were waiting for redemption in Jerusalem. And when they had performed all things, according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year, at the feast of the passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew it not, But supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey; and sought him among their kinsfolk and among their acquaintance. And not finding him, they went back to Jerusalem, seeking him. And after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished, at his understanding and answers. And seeing him they were amazed. And his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou done thus to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said to them, Why sought ye me? Knew ye not, that I must be about my Father's business? And they understood not the saying which he spake to them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them; but his mother kept all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, Annas being the high priest and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins: As it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth: And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. Then said he to the multitudes, that came forth to be baptized of him, Ye brood of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and say not within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father; for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. And now also the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire. And the multitude asked him, saying, What then shall we do? He answering saith to them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. And publicans also came to be baptized, and said to him, Master, what shall we do? And he said to them, Exact no more than what is appointed you. And the soldiers likewise asked him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your pay. And as the people were in expectation, and all mused in their hearts of John, whether he were not the Christ, John answered saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. And many other things in his exhortation preached he to the people. But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and concerning all the evils which Herod had done, Added also this above all, that he shut up John in prison. Now while all the people were baptizing, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily form, like a dove, upon him, and a voice came from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I delight. And Jesus was about thirty years of age, when he began his ministry, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli, The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son of Joseph, The son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Nagge, The son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Shimei, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah, The son of Johanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri, The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er, The son of Jose, the son of Eleazar, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, The son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Johanan, the son of Eliakim, The son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Booz, the son of Salmon, the son of Naasson, The son of Aminadab, the son of Aaron, the son of Esrom, the son of Phares, the son of Judah, The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, The son of Saruch, the son of Ragau, the son of Phalec, the son of Heber, the son of Sala, The son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, The son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Maleleel, the son of Cainan, The son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, Being forty days tempted by the devil. And in those days he ate nothing, and when they were ended he hungered. And the devil said to him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. And the devil taking him up into an high mountain, shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment. And the devil said to him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them; for it is delivered to me, and I give it to whomsoever I will. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answering said to him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the battlement of the temple, and said, If thou be the son of God, cast thyself down from hence: For it is written, He shall charge his angels concerning thee, to keep thee: And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And the devil, having ended all the temptation, departed from him till a convenient season. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of him, thro' all the region round about. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up; and as his custom was; he went into the synagogue on the sabbath, and stood up to read. And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah, and having opened the book, he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To publish the acceptable year of the Lord. And having closed the book, he gave it again to the servant, and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he said to them, This day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears. And they all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son? And he said to them, Ye will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself. Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy own country. And he said, Verily I say to you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country. I tell you of a truth, Many widows were in Israel, in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, while a great famine was thro' all the land. Yet to none of these was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a widow. And many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet none of them was healed, but Naaman the Syrian. And all in the synagogue hearing these things, were filled with fury, And rising up, thrust him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, to cast him down headlong. But he passing thro' the midst of them, went away. And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. And there was in the synagogue, a man who had a spirit of an unclean devil; and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, Let us alone: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy one of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And the devil having thrown him in the midst, came out of him, and hurt him not. And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What word is this, that with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out! And the same of him went forth into every place of the country round about. And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was ill of a fever, and they besought him for her. And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her: and immediately she arose and served them. Now when the sun was set, all that had any sick of divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. And devils also came out of many, crying out and saying, Thou art Christ, the Son of God. And he rebuking them, suffered them not to say, that they knew he was the Christ. And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the multitude sought him, and came to him, and detained him, that he might not depart from them. And he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also; for therefore am I sent. And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee. And as the multitude pressed on him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesareth, And saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. And going into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he desired him to thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the multitude out of the boat. When he had ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. But Simon answering said to him, Master, Having toiled all the night, we have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word, I will let down the net. And having done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net brake. And they beckoned to their partners, who were in the other boat, to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. Simon Peter seeing it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For astonishment seized him, and all that were with him, at the draught of fishes, which they had taken, And in like manner also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men. And when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed him. And when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy, who seeing Jesus, fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And putting forth his hand he touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. And he charged him to tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him, and great multitudes came together, to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities. But he withdrew into the deserts and prayed. And on a certain day as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and out of Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them. And behold men bringing on a couch a man that was ill of the palsy; and they sought to bring him in, and lay him before him. And not finding by what way they might bring him in thro' the multitude, they went upon the house, and let him down thro' the tiling with his couch into the midst, before Jesus. And seeing their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. And the scribes and the Pharisees reasoned, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only? And Jesus knowing their thoughts, answered and said to them, Why reason ye in your hearts? Which is easier? To say, Thy sins are forgiven thee? Or to say, Rise up and walk? But that ye may know, that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralytic) I say to thee, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thine house. And immediately rising up before them, and taking up that on which he lay, he went to his house, glorifying God. And they were all amazed and glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day. And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom, and said to him, Follow me. And leaving all, he rose up and followed him. And Levi made him a great entertainment, in his own house; and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. But the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? And Jesus answering said to them, They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John, and likewise of the Pharisees, fast often and make prayers; but thine eat and drink? And he said to them, Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bride-groom is with them? But the days will come, when the bride-groom shall be taken away from them: and then shall they fast in those days. He spake also a parable to them, No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; otherwise both the new maketh a rent, and the piece out of the new agreeth not with the old. And no man putteth new wine into old leathern-bottles: else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles will perish. But new wine must be put into new bottles, and both are preserved. And no man having drunk old wine, straightway desireth new; for he saith, The old is better. And on the first sabbath after the second day of unleavened bread, he went thro' the corn-fields, and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and ate, rubbing them in their hands. And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day? And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read, even this, what David did, when he hungered, and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the shew-bread, and gave also to them that were with him, which it is not lawful to eat, but for the priests only? And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. And on another sabbath also he went into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right-hand was withered. And the scribes and Pharisees watched, whether he would heal on the sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the withered hand, Rise up and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you, Which is lawful on the sabbath, To do good, or to do evil? To save life, or to kill? And looking round upon them all, he said to him, Stretch forth thy hand; and he did so: and his hand was restored as the other. And they were filled with madness, and talked one with another, what they should do to Jesus. And in those days he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in the prayer of God. And when it was day, he called to him his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom also he named Apostles: Simon (whom also he named Peter) and Andrew his brother: James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes, Jude the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor. And coming down with them, he stood on a plain, and the croud of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases: And they that were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were healed. And the whole multitude sought to touch him; for virtue went out of him, and healed them all. And lifting up his eyes on his disciples, he said, Happy are ye poor: for your's is the kingdom of God. Happy are ye that hunger now; for ye shall be satisfied: happy are ye that weep now; for ye shall laugh. Happy are ye when men shall hate you, and shall separate you from their company, and shall revile you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy; for behold your reward is great in heaven; for in like manner did their fathers to the prophets. But wo to you that are rich; for ye have your consolation. Wo to you that are full; for ye shall hunger: wo to you that laugh now; for ye shall mourn and weep. Wo to you, when all men shall speak well of you; for so did their fathers to the false prophets. But I say to you that hear, Love your enemies; do good to them that hate you, Bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you. And to him that smiteth thee on the cheek, offer also the other: and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to every man that asketh thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. For if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? For sinners also love those that love them. And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? For even sinners do the same. And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? For even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love ye your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the unthankful and the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemed; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete with, it shall be measured to you again. And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a ditch? The disciple is not above his master, but every one that is perfected, shall be as his master. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own eye? Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, thou thyself not seeing the beam that is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. For there is no good tree which bringeth forth corrupt fruit, neither a corrupt tree, which bringeth forth good fruit. For every tree is known by its own fruit; for they do not gather figs from thorns, nor from a bramble do they gather grapes. A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doth them, I will shew you to whom he is like. He is like a man, who built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream broke vehemently upon that house, but could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock. But he that heareth, and doth not, is like a man that built an house without a foundation upon the earth: against which the stream broke vehemently, and immediately it fell: and the breach of that house was great. Now when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. And hearing of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, beseeching him to come and heal his servant. And coming to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for whom thou shouldest do this. For he loveth our nation, and hath himself built us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof. Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it. Jesus hearing these things, marvelled at him, and turning, said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And they that had been sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. And he went afterward to a city called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him and a great multitude. And as he drew nigh the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude of the city was with her. And the Lord seeing her, was moved with tender compassion for her, and said, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise. And the dead man sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered him to his mother. And fear seized all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God hath visited his people. And this rumour of him went forth through all Judea, and all the country round about. And the disciples of John informed him of all these things. And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another? And the men being come to him, said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another? And in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues, and of evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight. And he answering said to them, Go and tell John the things ye have seen and heard: the blind see; the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed; the deaf hear; the dead are raised; to the poor the gospel is preached. And happy is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me. And when the messengers of John were departed, he said to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that are splendidly apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings palaces. But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee. For I say to you, among those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he. And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. But the Pharisees and scribes made void the counsel of God, toward themselves, being not baptized of him. To whom then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like? They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. The Son of man is come, eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by all her children. And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, he sat down to table. And behold a woman in the city, who had been a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, And standing at his feet behind him weeping, watered his feet with a shower of tears, and wiped them, with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. But the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known, who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner. And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, say on. A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. But they having nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both: Which therefore will love him most? Simon answering said, I suppose, he to whom he forgave most. He said to him, Thou hast rightly judged. And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath watered my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. Thou didst not anoint my head with oil: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say to thee, Those many sins of her's are forgiven; therefore she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth little. And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they that sat at table with him said within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace. And afterward he went through every city and village preaching and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him. And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven devils, And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance. And much people being gathered together, coming to him out of every city, he spake by a parable, A sower went forth to sow his seed: and while he sowed, some fell by the way-side; and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it. And some fell upon a rock, and springing up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundred fold. And saying these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. And his disciples asked him, What is this parable? And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others in parables, so that seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not understand. Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God. Those by the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. Those on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. But they have no root, who for a while believe; but in time of temptation fall away. That which fell among thorns are they, who, having heard, go forth, and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are they, who, having heard the word, keep it in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with perseverance. No man having lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light. For there is nothing hid that shall not be discovered, neither any thing concealed, that shall not be known and come to light. Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even what he hath. Then came toward him his mother and his brethren, but could not come to him for the croud. And it was told him by some who said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. And he answering said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God and keep it. And on a certain day he went into a vessel with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put to sea. And as they sailed, he fell asleep. And there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filled with water, and were in danger. And they came and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish! And he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm. And he said to them, Where is your faith? But they were afraid and wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this? For he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him. And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over-against Galilee. And as he went forth to land, there met him out of the city, a certain man that had had devils a long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in an house, but in the tombs. But seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What hast thou to do with me, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, torment me not.(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man: for many times it had caught him, and he had been kept bound with chains and fetters, and breaking the bands asunder, he had been driven by the spirit into the deserts.) And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; because many devils had entered into him. And they besought him, that he would not command them to go into the abyss. And there was an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him, that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them. Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a steep place into the lake and were choked. And they that fed them, seeing what was done, fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country. Then they went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid. They also that had seen it told them, How he that was possessed by the devils was healed. Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about, besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear, and he went in the vessel and returned. And the man out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, Return home, and shew what great things God hath done for thee. And he went and published through the whole city, how great things Jesus had done for him. And when Jesus returned, the people gladly received him; for they were all waiting for him. And behold there came a man named Jairus, and he was ruler of the synagogue; and falling down at the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house. For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went, the people thronged him. And a woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years, and had spent all her living upon Physicians, neither could be healed by any, Came behind him and touched the border of his garment, and immediately her issue of blood stanched. And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? And Jesus said, Some one hath touched me; for I know that virtue is gone out of me. And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared to him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she had been healed immediately. And he said to her, Daughter, take courage: thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the master. Jesus hearing it answered him, saying, Fear not; believe only, and she shall be made whole. And coming into the house, he suffered none to go in, save Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the maiden. And all wept and bewailed her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead; but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. And he put them all out, and taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maid, arise. And her spirit returned, and she arose straightway, and he commanded to give her meat. And her parents were astonished: but he charged them, to tell no man that which had been done. And calling together the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases. And he sent them to preach the gospel of the kingdom, and to heal the sick. And said to them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money: neither have two coats apiece. And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide and thence depart. And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. And they departed, and went thro' the towns preaching the Gospel and healing every where. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some, That John was risen from the dead; and by some that Elijah had appeared; by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. And Herod said, John have I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him. And the apostles returning told him what they had done. And he took them and went aside privately into the desert of Bethsaida. And when the multitudes knew it, they followed him, and he received them and spake to them of the kingdom of God and healed them that had need of healing. And the day began to decline. And the twelve coming to him said, send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge and find victuals: for we are here in a desert place. But he said to them, give ye them to eat. And they said, we have no more than five loaves and two fishes, except we should go and buy meat for all this people. For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down, by fifties in a company. And they did so, and made them all sit down. Then taking the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. And they all ate and were satisfied, and there were taken up of fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And as he was praying apart, his Disciples were with him. And he asked them saying, whom say the people that I am? They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again. He said to them, but whom say ye, that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God. But he straitly charged and commanded them, to tell this to no man, saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day. And he said to all, if any man be willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow me. For who|oever will save his life shall gose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, he shall save it: For what is a man profited, if he gain the whble world, and lose himself, or be cast away? For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's and that of the holy angels. And I tell you of a truth there are some standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. And about eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and James and John, and went up into a mountain to pray. And as he prayed, the fashien of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. And behold two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah, Who appearing in glory, spake of his decease, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. But Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep; and awaking they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. And just as they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents, ane for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said. While he spake thus, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they feared while they entered into the cloud. And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear ye him. And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone: and they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen. And the next day, as they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met him. And behold a man from the croud, cried aloud saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is my only child. And lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him, that he foameth, and bruising him, hardly departeth from him. And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not. And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring thy son hither. And as he was yet coming, the devil threw him down and tore him: and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. And while they all wondered at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples, Let these sayings sink down into your ears; for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men. But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, so that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of this saying. And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest? And Jesus seeing the thought of their heart, took a little child, and sat him by him, And said to them, whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great. And John answering said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him; because he followeth not with us. And Jesus said to him, forbid him not, for he that is not against you is for you. And when the time was fulfilled, that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, And sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. But they did not receive him, because his face was, as tho' he would go to Jerusalem. And his disciples James and John seeing it said, Lord, Wilt thou that we bid fire come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did? But he turning rebuked them and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of: For the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them. And they went to another village. And as they went in the way, one said to him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. But Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests: but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, Suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but suffer me first to bid them farewell that are in my house. Jesus said to him, No man having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two by two into every place, whither he himself intended to come. And he said to them, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. Go: behold I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry not purse or scrip or shoes, and salute no man by the way. And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. And remain in the same house eating and drinking such things as they have; for the labourer is worthy of his hire: go not from house to house. And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you. And heal the sick that are therein, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come nigh to you. But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, going out into the streets of it, say, Even the dust of your city which cleaveth to our feet, do we wipe off against you: yet know this, that the kingdom of God is at hand. I say to you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city. Wo to thee, Chorazin, wo to thee Bethsaida; for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which hast been exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell. He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me, rejecteth him that sent me. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us thro' thy name. And he said to them, I beheld Satan falling as lightning from heaven. Behold I give ydu power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall in any wise hurt you. Yet in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, that your names are written in heaven. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered to me of my Father; and no one knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him. And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see. For I tell you, many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them. And behold, a certain scribe stood up, and trying him, said, Master, what shall I do, to inherit eternal life? He said to him, What is written in the law? How readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. And he said to him, Thou hast answered right: this do and thou shalt live. But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour? And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who having stripped and wounded him departed, leaving him half dead. And it came to pass that a certain priest came down that way, and seeing him, passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan journeying, came where he was, and seeing him, was moved with tender compassion, And going to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and setting him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow departing, he took out two pieces of money, and gave them to the host, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, as I come back I will repay thee. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was the neighbour to him that fell among the robbers? And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go and do thou likewise. And as they went, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who also sitting at the feet of Jesus, heard his discourse. But Martha was incumbered with much serving; and coming to him she said, Lord, dost thou not care, that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore help me. But Jesus answering said to her, Martha, Martha! Thou art careful and hurried about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her. And as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done as in heaven, so on earth. Give us day by day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves: For a friend of mine on his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him: And he from within shall answer, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed: I cannot rise and give thee? I tell you, though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet, because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion? If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb: and when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake, and the people wondered. But some of them said, He casteth out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils: And others tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven. But he knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falleth. If Satan then be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? Because ye say, that I cast out devils by Beelzebub. And if I cast out devils by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast out devils by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God is come upon you. While the strong one armed guardeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when he that is stronger than him cometh upon him and overcometh him, he taketh from him his compleat armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry places, seeking rest: and finding none, he saith, I will return to my house whence I came out. And coming he findeth it swept and garnished. Then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and entering in they dwell there; and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. As he spake these things, a certain woman lifting up her voice out of the multitude said to him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked! But he said, Yea, rather blessed are they, that hear the word of God and keep it. And the multitudes being gathered thick together, he said, This is an evil generation: it seeketh a sign; but no sign shall be given it, save the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here. The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here. No man having lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light. The eye is the lamp of the body: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body is full of light, but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. Take heed therefore, left the light that is in thee be darkness. If then thy whole body be full of light, not having any part dark, the whole shall be as full of light, as when a lamp enlightens thee with its bright shining. And as he spake, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And he went in and sat down to table. But the Pharisee seeing it, marvelled, that he had not first washed before dinner. And the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the dish; but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness. Ye unthinking men, did not he that made the outside, make the inside also? But give what is in them in alms, and behold all things are clean to you. But wo to you, Pharisees; for ye tythe mint and rue and all herbs; and pass by justice and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Wo to you, Pharisees; for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the markets. Wo to you; for ye are as graves which appear not, and men that walk over them are not aware. And one of the lawyers answering said to him, Master, thus saying, thou reproachest us also. And he said, Wo to you lawyers also; for ye load men with burthens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burthens with one of your fingers. Wo to you; for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets; whom your fathers killed. Truly ye bear witness that ye approve the deeds of your fathers: for whom they killed, ye build their sepulchres. Therefore also the wisdom of God hath said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will slay, and persecute the rest. So that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world, shall be required of this generation. From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was destroyed between the temple and the altar: verily I say to you, it shall be required of this generation. Woe to you, lawyers; for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye have not entered in yourselves; and them that were entering in, ye have hindered. And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began fiercely to fasten upon him, and to urge him to speak of many things, Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him. In the mean time, an innumerable multitude being gathered together, so that they trod one upon another, he said to his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. For there is nothing covered that shall not be uncovered, neither hid, that shall not be made known: So that whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness, shall be heard in the light, and what ye have whispered in closets shall be proclaimed on the house-tops. But I say to you, my friends; Fear not them that kill the body, and after that can do no more: But I will shew you whom ye shall fear: fear him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell: yea, I say to you, fear him. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. And I say to you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God. But he that denieth me before man, shall be denied before the angels of God. And whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven. But when they bring you to the synagogues and to magistrates and powers, take no thought how or what ye shall answer or what ye shall say. For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that hour, what ye ought to say. And one out of the croud said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? And he said to them, Take heed and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. And he spake a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully. And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do? For I have no room where to stow my fruits. And he said, This I will do: I will pull down my barns and build greater; and there will I stow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years: take thine ease; eat, drink, and be merry. But God said to him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: and whose shall the things be that thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life what ye shall eat, neither for the body what ye shall put on. The life is more than meat, and the body than raiment. Consider the ravens; for they neither sow nor reap; neither have store-house nor barn: yet God feedeth them. How much better are ye than the birds? And which of you by taking thought, can add the least measure to his age? If ye then be not able to do that which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. If then God so cloth the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the still, how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith? And seek not ye, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of a doubtful mind. For the nations of the world seek all these things; and your Father knoweth that ye need these things. But seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you. Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell what ye have and give alms: provide yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Let your loins be girt, and your lamps burning, And be like men that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the wedding, that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately. Happy are those servants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, shall find watching; verily I say to you, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down to table, and will come forth and serve them. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, happy are those servants. And this ye know, that if the master of the house had known, what hour the thief would have come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broke open. Therefore be ye also ready; for the Son of man cometh in an hour when ye think not. Then Peter said to him, Lord, speakest thou this parable to us, or also to all? And the Lord said, Who is that faithful and wise steward, whom his Lord shall make ruler over his housoold, to give the allowance of food in due season? Happy is that servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say to you, he will set him over all that he hath. But if that servant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to beat the men servants and maidens, and to eat, and drink, and be drunken: The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he expecteth not, and at an hour when he knoweth not, and will cut him in sunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful. And that servant who knew his Lord's will, and prepared not, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For to whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required; and to whom they have committed much, of him they will ask the more. I am come to send fire on the earth. And what do I desire? That it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to be baptized with: and how am I straitned till it be accomplished! Suppose ye that I am come to send peace upon earth? I tell you, Nay, but rather division. For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And he said to the people also, When ye see a cloud rising out of the west, straitway ye say, There cometh a heavy shower, and so it is. And when ye find the south wind blowing, ye say, There will be sultry heat; and it is so. Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the earth and of the sky: how do ye not discern this season? Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? When thou art going with thine adversary to the magistrate, give diligence in the way to be delivered from him: lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. I tell thee, thou shalt in no wise come out thence, till thou hast paid the last mite. And there were present at that season, some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And Jesus answering said to them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things; I tell you, Nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them, suppose ye, that they were sinners above all that dwelt at Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. He spake also this parable. A man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came, seeking fruit thereon and found none. Then said he to the keeper of the vineyard, Behold three years I come seeking fruit of this fig tree, and find aone: cut it down: why doth it also cumber the ground? And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it and dung it. Perhaps it may bear fruit: but if not, after that thou shalt cut it down. And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. And behold, there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together and utterly unable to lift up herself. And Jesus seeing her, called her to him, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity. And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. And the ruler of the synagogue, being much displeased, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, answered and said, There are six days, in which man ought to work: on these therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath. The Lord answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each of you loose his ox or ass from the stall on the sabbath, and lead him away to watering! And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound lo these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath? And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I resemble it? It is like a grain of mustard-seed which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in the branches of it. Again he said, Whereto shall I liken the kingdom of God? It is like leaven, which a woman took and covered up in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. And he went thro' the cities and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that are saved? And he said to him, Strive to enter in thro' the strait gate; for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and knock at the door saying, Lord, Lord, open to us: He shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are. Then shall ye say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. But he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out. And they shall come from the east and the west, and the north and the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. But behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last. The same day came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Go out and depart from hence; for Herod is minded to kill thee. And he said to them, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow; and the third day I am perfected. But I must go on to day, and to morrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a bird gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold your house is left to you desolate; and verily I say to you, Ye shall not see me, till the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. And as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees on the sabbath, to eat bread, they watched him. And behold there was a certain man before him, who had the dropsy. And Jesus answering spake to the scribes and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? But they held their peace. And he took him and healed him and let him go, And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? And they could not answer him again to these things. And he spake a parable to them that were invited, when he marked how they chose the chief seats, saying to them, When thou art invited by any man to a marriage-feast, sit not down in the highest place, lest a more honourable man than thou be invited by him, And he that invited thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place. And then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place. But when thou art invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour in the presence of them that sit at table with thee. For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. Then said he also to him that had invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours, lest they also invite thee again, and a recompence be made thee. But when thou makest an entertainment, invite the poor, the disabled, the lame, the blind, And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee; but thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. And one of them that sat at table with him, hearing these things, said to him, Happy is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many. And he sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were invited, Come, for all things are now ready. And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a field, I must needs go and see it: I pray thee, have me excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. So the servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the disabled, and the lame, and the blind. And the servant said, Sir, it is done as thou hast commanded; and yet there is room. And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited, shall taste of my supper. And great multitudes went with him. And he turned and said to them, If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple. And which of you intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and computeth the cost, whether he hath sufficient to finish it? Lest haply after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold mock him, saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. Or what king marching to incounter another king in war, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand, to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? If not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an embassage, and desireth conditions of peace. So every one of you, who forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my disciple. Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? It is neither fit for the land nor yet for dung; they cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Then drew near to him all the publicans and sinners, to hear him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying, This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them. And he spake a parable to them, saying, Who of you, having an hundred sheep, and losing one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, till he find it? And having found it, he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing. And coming home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say to you, Thus joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, who do not need repentance. Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? And having found it, she calleth her friends and neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. Thus, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God, over one sinner that repenteth. And he said, A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father; Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided to them his substance. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and took a journey into a far country, and there squandered away his substance, living riotously. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields, to feed swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate: and no man gave to him. And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger? I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee: I am no more worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose and came to his father: But while he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and his bowels yearned, and he ran, and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry. For this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry. Now his elder son was in the field. And as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. And calling one of the servants, he asked what these things meant? And he told him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him in good health. But he was angry, and would not go in: therefore his father coming out intreated him. And he answering said to his father, Lo these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I thy commandment at any time, yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. But as soon as this thy son was come, who hath devoured thy substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. And he said to him, Son, thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine. But it was meet to make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found. And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and he was accused to him as wasting his goods. And calling him, he said to him, Why hear I this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer steward. And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? For my lord taketh away the stewardship from me. I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed. I know what to do, that when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. So having called to him every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord? And he said, An hundred measures of oil. He said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? He said, An hundred measures of wheat. He saith, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely; for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. He that is faithful in the least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will intrust you with the true riches? And if ye have not been fauthful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or he will cleave to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard these things, and they derided him. And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men: but God knoweth your hearts: And that which is highly esteemed among men, is an abomination before God. The law and the Prophets were until John: from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man forceth into it. Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than for one tittle of the law to fail. Whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adultery. There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted splendidly every day. And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores; and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table: yea, the dogs also came and licked his sores. And the beggar died and was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died and was buried: And in hell lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember, that thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And besides all this, between us and you, there is a great gulph fixed; so that they who would pass from us to you, cannot, neither can they pass to us that would come from thence. Then he said, I pray thee, therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: For I have five brethren; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment. Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent. And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded tho' one rose from the dead. Then said he to the disciples, It is impossible but offences will come; but wo to him through whom they come. It were better for him that a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones. Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him. And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day return to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him. And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith. And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. But which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him as soon as he cometh from the field, Come and sit down to table? And will not rather say to him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not. So likewise ye, when ye have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are but unprofitable servants: we have done what was our duty to do. And as he went to Jerusalem, he passed thro' the confines of Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten lepers, who stood afar off: And they lifted up their voice and said, Jesus, master, have mercy on us. And seeing them, he said to them, Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and with a loud voice glorified God. And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? There are not found to give glory to God, save this stranger. And he said to him, Arise and go, thy faith hath saved thee. And being asked by the Pharisees, When cometh the kingdom of God, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God, cometh not with observation. Neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is within you. And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it. And when they shall say to you, See here; see there: go not, nor follow them. Ior as the lightning that lightneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven, so shall also the Son of man be in his day. But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the son of man. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded: But the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed. In that day, he that shall be on the house-top and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot's wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his life, shall preserve it. I tell you, in this night, there shall be two men in one bed; one shall be taken and the other left. Two women shall be grinding together; one shall be taken and the other left. Two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken and the other left. And they answering said to him, Where Lord? And he said to them, Wheresoever the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together. And he spake a parable to them to this end, that they ought always to pray, and not to faint; Saying, There was in a certain city a judge who feared not God nor reverenced man. And there was a widow in that city, and she came to him, saying, Do me justice on mine adversary. And he would not for a while, but afterwards he said in himself, Tho' I fear not God nor reverence man, Yet because this widow giveth me trouble, I will do her justice, left by her continual coming she weary me out. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith? And shall not God vindicate his own elect, who cry to him day and night, though he bear long with them? I tell you he will vindicate them speedily. Yet when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith upon earth? And he spake this parable to certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others. Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed thus, God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week: I give tythes of all that I possess. And the publican standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. And they brought to him infants also, that he might touch them; but the disciples seeing it, rebuked them. But Jesus calling them to him, said, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no wise enter therein. And a certain ruler asked him saying, Good master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good save one, that is God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery. Do not murder, Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Honour thy father and thy mother. And he said, All these have I kept from my childhood. Jesus hearing these things said to him, Yet lackest thou one thing: Sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful; for he was very rich. And Jesus seeing that he was very sorrowful, said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God? It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? And he said, The things impossible with men, are possible with God. Then Peter said, Lo we have left all and followed thee. And he said to them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, Who shall not receive manifold more in the present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. Then he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets shall be accomplished on the Son of man. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully intreated, and spitted on: And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. And while he was yet nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging. And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked, what it meant? And they told him, Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. And he cried aloud saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me. And they that went before charged him to hold his peace; but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus standing still, commanded him to be brought to him: and when he was come near, he asked him, Saying, What wilt thou that I should do for thee? He said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said to him, Receive thy sight, thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: And all the people seeing it gave praise to God. And he entered and passed through Jericho. And behold a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief of the publicans. Now this was a rich man. And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and could not for the croud, because he was little of stature. And running before, he climbed into a sycamore tree, to see him, for he was to pass by that way. And Jesus, when he came to the place, looking up saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. And seeing it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone to be guest with a sinner. And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man wrongfully, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said to him, To day is salvation come to this house; forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh Jerusalem, and because they thought the kingdom of God would immediately appear. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. And having called ten of his servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade till I come. But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. And when he was returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, to know what each had gained by trading. Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. And he said to him, Well done, good servant; because thou hast been faithful in a very little, be thou governor over ten cities. And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. And he said to him likewise, Be thou also over five cities. And another came saying, Lord, behold thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin. For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layest not down, and reapest what thou didst not sow. And he saith to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow. Wherefore then gavest thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have received it with interest? And he said to them that stood by, Take the pound from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.(And they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds!) For I say unto you, To every one that hath shall be given: but from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken away from him. Moreover those my enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay before me. And having said these things. he went before, going up to Jerusalem. And as he drew nigh to Bethpage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying, Go ye into the village over against you, in which entering, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man yet sat; loose him and bring him hither. And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him, thus shall ye say to him, The Lord hath need of him. And they that were sent went, and found even as he had said to them. And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them, Why loose ye the colt? And they said, The Lord hath need of him. And they brought him to Jesus, and they cast their garments on the colt and set Jesus thereon. And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. And when he was now come nigh, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had seen, Saying, Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord: Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. And he answering said to them, I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. And as he drew near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, O that thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day the things that are for thy peace. But now they are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and press thee on every side, And shall dash thee against the ground, and thy children, that are in thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. And going into the temple, he drove out them that sold and them that bought therein. Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves. And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people, sought to destroy him, And found not what they might do; for all the people hung upon him to hear him. And on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, And spake to him saying, Tell us, by what authority dost thou these things, and who is he that gave thee this authority? And he answering said, I will also ask you one thing and tell me, Was the baptism of John from heaven or of men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say from heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? But if we say of men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. And they answered, They could not tell whence. Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you, by what authority I do these things. Then he spake this parable to the people: A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they might give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat and sent him away empty. And again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also, and cast him out. Then said the Lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps seeing him they will reverence him. But the husbandmen seeing him, reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: Come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do to them? He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others. And hearing it they said, God forbid. And he looked on them and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, this is become the head of the corner? Whosoever shall fall on that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him the same hour; but they feared the people; for they knew he had spoken this parable against them. And watching him, they sent forth spies, feigning themselves to be just men, to take hold of his discourse, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governour. And they asked him, saying, Master, we know, that thou speakest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou persons, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful for us, to give tribute to C?sar, or no? But he observing their craftiness, said to them, Why tempt ye me? Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answering said, C?sar's. He said, Render therefore to C?sar the things which are C?sar's, and to God the things which are God's. And they could not take hold of his words before the people; and marvelling at his answer, they held their peace. Then certain of the Saducees, who deny there is any resurrection, coming to him asked him, saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. Now there were seven brethren, and the first took a wife, and died without children. And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. And the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they died and left no children. Last of all the woman died also. Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them is she? For seven had her to wife. And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage. But they who are accounted worthy to obtaan that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage. For neither can they die any more; for they are equal to angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. But that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord, The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; so that all live to him. And some of the scribes answering said, Master, Thou hast spoken excellently well. And after that, they durst not ask him any question at all. And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David's son? And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. David therefore calleth him Lord: How is he then his son? Then in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts, Who devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater damnation. And looking up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury. And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither tuo mites. And he said, Of a truth I say to you, This poor widow hath cast in more than they all. For all these have of their abundance cast into the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had. And as some spake of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said, As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. And they asked him saying, Master, when shall these things be? And what is the sign, when these things shall come to pass? And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ: And the time is near. Go ye not after them. And when ye shall hear of wars, and commotions, be not terrified; for these things must be first; but the end is not immediately. Then said he to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines and pestilences, and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven. But before all these things they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake. And it shall turn to you for a testimony. Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to premeditate what to answer. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or resist. But ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. And ye shall be hated by all men for my names sake. But there shall not an hair of your head perish. In your patience possess ye your souls. And when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let them that are in the midst of it, depart out, and let not them that are in the countries, enter thereinto. For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days; for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath on this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden by the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. And there shall be signs in the sun, and moon, and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea roaring and tossing: Men fainting away for fear, and expectation of the things coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to come to pass, look up and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. And he spake a parable to them, Behold the fig-tree and all the trees. When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of yourselves, that summer is now nigh. So likewise when ye see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is nigh. Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away. But take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overloaded with gluttony, and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore and pray always, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things which will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. Now by day he was teaching in the temple; and at night going out he lodged at the mount called the mount of Olives. And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him. Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; but they feared the people. Then entered Satan into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. And he went and talked with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them. And they were glad and agreed to give him money. And he promised and sought opportunity to betray him to them, in the absence of the multitude. And the first day of unleavened bread was come, when the passover was to be killed. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat it. And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? And he said to them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, a man will meet you bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth. And say to the master of the house, The master saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? And he will shew you a large upper-room furnished: there make ready. And they went, and found as he had said to them. And they made ready the passover. And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. And he said to them, With desire have I desired to eat this passover with you, before I suffer. For I say to you, I will not eat thereof any more, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. And he took the cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves. For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God shall come. And he took bread, and gave thanks and brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you. But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. And truly the Son of man goeth as it was determined; but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed. And they inquired among themselves, Which of them it was, that would do this? There was also a contention among them, Which of them was greatest. And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and they that exercise authority upon them have the title of benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief as he that serveth. For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you as he that serveth. Ye are they who have continued with in me in my temptations. And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father to me, That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not: and when thou art returned, strengthen thy brethren. And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death. And he said, I tell thee, Peter, it shall not be the time of cockcrowing this day, before thou wilt thrice deny that thou knowest me. And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. Then said he to them, But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip; and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one. For I say to you, That this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was numbered with the transgressors. For the things concerning me have an end. And they said, Behold here are two swords. And he said to them, it is enough. And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him. And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeling down, he prayed, saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine be done. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down on the ground. And rising up from prayer, he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow, And said to them, Why sleep ye? Rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him. And Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? When they who were about him saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And Jesus answering said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, who were come to him, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs? When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour and the power of darkness. Then took they him, and led him, and brought him to the high-priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sat down together, Peter sat down among them. But a certain maid seeing him as he sat by the light, and looking earnestly upon him, said, This man also was with him. But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. And after a while another saw him and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. And about one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou meanest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. And the Lord turning looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before cock-crowing, thou wilt deny me thrice. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. And the men that held Jesus mocked and smote him. And having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. And when it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, Saying, Art thou the Christ? Tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe. And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right-hand of the power of God. And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? He said, Ye say it: I am. And they said, What farther need have we of witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth. And the whole multitude of them arose and led him to Pilate. And they accused him saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, saying, that he himself is Christ a king. And Pilate asked him saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering him said, Thou sayest. Then said Pilate to the chief priests and the multitude, I find no fault in this man. But they were the more violent saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, to this place. Pilate hearing of Galilee asked, If the man was a Galilean? And when he knew, that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also in Jerusalem at that time. And Herod seeing Jesus was exceeding glad; for he had been long desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. And he questioned him in many words, but he answered him nothing. And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. And Herod, having with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a splendid robe, sent him back to Pilate. And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people, Said to them, Ye have brought this man to me, as perverting the people; and behold, I having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man, touching the things whereof ye accuse him. Nor yet Herod; for I sent you to him; and lo, he hath done nothing worthy of death. I will therefore chastise and release him. For he was under a necessity of releasing one to them at the feast. And they cried all at once saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:(Who for an insurrection made in the city, and for murder had been cast into prison.) Pilate desiring to release Jesus, spake again to them. But they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him. He said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise and release him. But they insisted with loud voices, requiring that he should be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. And Pilate gave sentence, that what they desired should be done. And he released to them him, that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. And as they led him away, they laid hold on one Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. And there followed him a great company of people and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold the days are coming in which they will say, Happy are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps that never gave suck. Then shall they say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry? And there were also led two other men, malefactors, to be put to death with him. And when they were come to the place, called the place of a scull, there they crucified him, and the two malefactors, one on the right-hand, and one on the left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment and cast lots. And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others: let him save himself, if he be the Christ, the chosen of God. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. And a superscription also was written over him in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors, who were hanging on the cross, reviled him, saying, If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us. But the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this person hath done nothing amiss. And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me, when thou comest in thy kingdom. And Jesus said to him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise. And it was about the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth till the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And Jesus crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And having said thus, he expired. And the centurion seeing what was done, glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. And all the people who had come together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, returned, smiting their breasts. And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. And behold there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor, a good man and a just:(He had not consented to the counsel and deed of them) of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God: This man going to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus. And taking it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. And the women who had come with him from Galilee, following after, beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And returning they prepared spices and ointments, and rested the sabbath, according to the commandment. And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices, which they had prepared and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre, And entering, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And while they were perplexed concerning it, behold two men stood by them in shining garments. And as they were afraid, and bowed down their face to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spake to you being yet in Galilee, Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and rise again the third day. And they remembered his words, And returning from the sepulchre, told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles. And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. But Peter rising, ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, he seeth the linen clothes laid by themselves; and he went home, wondring at what was come to pass. And behold two of them were going the same day to a village called Emmaus, which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And as they talked and argued together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were holden, so that they did not know him. And he said to them, What discourses are these that ye have one with another, and are sad? And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Dost thou alone even sojourn at Jerusalem, and hast not known the things, which are come to pass there in these days? And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Those concerning Jesus of Nazareth (who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,) How our chief priests and rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him, But we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women of our company astonished us, who were early at the sepulchre, And not finding his body, they came, saying, That they had seen also a vision of angels, who say, he is alive. And some of the men who were with us, went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said; but him they saw not. Then he said to them, O foolish, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things in all the scriptures, concerning himself. And they drew nigh the village whither they were going, and he made as tho' he would go farther. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day declines. And he went in, to abide with them. And as he sat at table with them, he took the bread, and blessed it, and brake and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he was talking to us in the way, and opening the scriptures to us? And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven met together, and them that were with them, saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. And they told the things done in the way, and how he was known by them in the breaking of the bread. And as they spake thus, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace be unto you. But being terrified and affrighted, they thought they saw a spirit. And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do reasonings arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have. And having spoken this, he shewed them his hands and his feet. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any meat? And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb. And he took it, and ate before them. And he said to them, These are the words which I spake to you, being yet with you, that all things written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms concerning me, must be fulfilled. Then opened he their understanding, to understand the scriptures, And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things. And behold I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry in the city Jerusalem, till ye be clothed with power from on high. And he led them out as far as Bethany; and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.In the beginning existed the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not one single thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, but the darkness perceived it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a testimony, to testify of the light, that all thro' it might believe. He was not the light, but was sent to testify of the light. This was the true light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him; yet the world knew him not. He came to his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he privilege to become the sons of God, to them that believe in his name: Who were born, not of blood, nor by the will of the flesh, nor by the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. John testified of him and cried, saying, This is he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me. And out of his fulness have we all received, even grace upon grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth was by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou? And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked him, What then, Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they to him, Who art thou? That we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah. And they who were sent were of the Pharisees. And they asked him and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet? John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not. He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unloose. These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. The next day he seeth Jesus coming toward him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is preferred before me; for he was before me. And I knew him not, but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. And John testified, saying, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water, he had said to me, On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, this is he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw it, and testified, that this is the Son of God. Again, the next day, John was standing, and two of his disciples. And looking upon Jesus walking, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God. And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. And Jesus turning and seeing them following, saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (that is, being interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou? He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour. Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John speak and followed him. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted the Christ.) And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, Peter. The day following he was minded to depart into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, Follow me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael and saith to him, We have found him, whom Moses in the law and the prophets described, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathanael saith to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile. Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. Nathagael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these. Verily, verily I say to you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man. And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage. And wine falling short, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have not wine. Jesus saith to her, Woman, what is it to me and thee? Mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith to the servants, Whatsoever he saith to you, do. And there were set there six water-pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece. Jesus saith to them, Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith to them, Draw out now, and carry to the governor of the feast. And they carried it. When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine (he knew not whence it was, but the servants, who had drawn the water knew) the governor of the feast calleth the bridegroom, And saith to him, Every man doth set out good wine first, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine till now. Jesus wrought this beginning of miracles in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed on him. After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they tarried there not many days. For the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, And found in the temple them that fold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. And having made a scourge of rushes, he drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers money, and otherthrew the tables, And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of traffick. And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign shewest thou us, seeing thou dost these things? Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? But he spake of the temple of his body. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, on the feast day, many believed in his name, beholding the miracles which he did. But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, And needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man. Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know, that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles which thou dost, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born, when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it lifteth, and thou hearest the found thereof, but canst not tell, whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be? Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily I say to thee, we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; yet ye receive not our testimony. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how would ye believe, if I told you heavenly things? For no one hath gone up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, That whosoever believeth on him, may not perish, but have everlasting life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him, may not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved thro' him. He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that practiseth the truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God. After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and there he tarried with them and baptized. And John also was baptizing in Enon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized. For John was not yet cast into prison. Then there arose a dispute between some of John's disciples and the Jews, about purifying. And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him. John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven. Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease. He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: yet no man receiveth his testimony. He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal, that God is true. For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God; for God giveth not him the Spirit by measure. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: but he that obeyeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. When therefore the Lord knew, that the Pharisees had heard, Jesus maketh and baptizeth more disciples than John,(Tho' Jesus himself batized not; but his disciples) He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee. And he must needs go thro' Samaria. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with the journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.(For his disciples were gone to the city to buy meat.) Then saith the woman of Samaria to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank thereof, and his children, and his cattle? Jesus answered and said to her, Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst again. But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, will never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, will be in him a fountain of water, springing up into everlasting life. The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband. For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: in this thou saidst truly. The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain: but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus saith to her, Woman, Believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship; for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such worshipers. God is a spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth. The woman saith to him, I know that the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith to her, I that speak to thee, am He. And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with a woman. Yet none said, What seekest thou? Or, Why talkest thou with her? The woman then left her water-pot, and went to the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I did: Is not this the Christ? Then they went out of the city, and came to him. In the mean time his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. But he said to them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. The disciples said one to another, Hath any man brought him to eat? Jesus saith to them, My meat is, to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. Say ye not, There are yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and survey the fields, for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal, that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. And herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. I have sent you to reap that whereon ye have bestowed no labour: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labour. And many of the Samaritans out of that city believed on him, for the saying of the woman testifying, He told me all that ever I did. So when the Samaritans were come to him, they besought him to tarry with them. And he abode there two days. And many more believed, because of his word, And said to the woman, We no longer believe, because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. After the two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.(Now Jesus himself had testified, That a prophet hath not honour in his own country.) And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast. For they also had come to the feast. So he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him, to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. Jesus said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe. The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down, ere my child die. Jesus saith to him, Go: thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus spake to him, and he went. And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. Then he asked of them the hour when he amended. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. So the father knew, it was at the same hour, in which Jesus had said to him, Thy son liveth. And himself believed, and his whole house. This second miracle again Jesus wrought, being come out of Judea into Galilee. After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem, by the sheep-gate, a bath, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porticos. In these lay a great multitude of diseased, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at certain times into the bath, and the water was troubled: and whosoever went in first, after the troubling of the water, was made whole, whatsoever disease he had. And a certain man was there, who had been diseased eight and thirty years. Jesus seeing him lie, and knowing that he had now been diseased a long time, saith to him, Desirest thou to be made whole? The infirm man answered him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the bath, when the water is troubled; and while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed and walk. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked: and the same day was the sabbath. Then said the Jews to him that was healed, It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up the bed. He answered, He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed and walk. Then asked they him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk? And he that was healed knew not who he was; for Jesus had retired, a multitude being in the place. Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Lo, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee. The man departed and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole. And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath. But Jesus answered them, My father worketh until now, and I work. Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also said, that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God. Then answered Jesus and said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do; but what things soever he doth, these also doth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doth: and he will shew him greater works than these, so that ye will marvel. For as the Father raiseth and quickeneth the dead, so the Son also quickeneth whom he will. For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath given all judgment to the Son: That all men may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that sent him. Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not into condemnation, but is passed from death to life. Verily, verily I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son also to have life in himself, And hath given him authority, to execute judgment likewise, because he is the Son of man. Marvel not at this: for the time is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth, they that have done good, to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation. I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just: because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me. If I testify of myself, my testimony is not valid. There is another that testifieth of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifieth of me is valid. Ye sent to John, and he bare testimony to the truth. But I receive not testimony from man; but these things I say, that ye may be saved. He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to fulfil, the very works which I do, testify of me, that the Father hath sent me. And the Father who hath sent me, he hath testified of me: ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form. And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, ye believe not. Search the scriptures: in them ye think ye have eternal life: and it is they that testify of me. Yet ye will not come to me, that ye may have life. I receive not honour from men, But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. For I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. How can ye believe, while ye receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that is from God only? Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? After these things, Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, the sea of Tiberias, And a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the miracles which he did on the diseased. But Jesus went up into a mountain, and sat there with his disciples. And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. Jesus then lifting up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming to him, saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?(But this he said, trying him; for he himself knew what he intended to do.) Philip answered him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each of them may take a little. One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him, Here is a lad, who hath five barley-loaves and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? Jesus said, Make the men sit down. (Now there was much grass in the place) So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. Then Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sat down, and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. When they were filled, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost. They therefore gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten. Then those men, having seen the miracle which Jesus did, said, Of a truth this is the prophet that was to come into the world. Jesus therefore knowing, that they were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, again retired to the mountain all alone. In the evening, his disciples went down to the sea, And entering into the vessel, they went over the sea toward Capernaum: And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. And the sea ran high, a great wind blowing. And having rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh to the ship: and they were afraid. But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid. Then they willingly received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were bound. The day following, the multitude who had stood on the other side of the sea, because they saw there was no other vessel there, save that one into which his disciples went, and that Jesus went not into the vessel with his disciples, but that his disciples were gone away alone:(But there came other little vessels from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks) When they saw, that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also went aboard the vessels, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus. And having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? Jesus answered them and said, Verily I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were satisfied. Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you; for him hath God the Father sealed. Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God? Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. They said therefore to him, What sign dost thou then, that we may see and believe thee? What dost thou work? Our fathers ate manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. Then said Jesus to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, Moses gave you not the bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world. Then said they to him, Lord, ever give us this bread. And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I told you, that tho' ye have seen me, ye believe not. All that the Father giveth me, will come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the will of him that sent me, That of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. The Jews then murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then saith he, I came down from heaven? Jesus answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves. No man can come to me, unless the Father who hath sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh to me. Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he who is from God; he hath seen the Father. Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and yet died. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. The Jews then debated among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? But Jesus said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he that eateth of this bread, shall live for ever. These things he said in the synagogue, teaching at Capernaum. Many of his disciples hearing it, said, This is an hard saying: who can hear it? Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured about this, said to them, Doth this offend you? What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend where he was before? It is the Spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken, they are spirit and they are life. But there are some of you who believe not. (For Jesus had known from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who would betray him.) Therefore said I to you, That no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father. From this time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. Then said Jesus to the twelve, Are ye also minded to go away? Then Simon Peter answered him, saying, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we have believed and known, that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve? Yet one of you is a devil. He spake of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he it was that would betray him, being one of the twelve. After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. Now the Jews feast of tabernacles was nigh. His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence and go into Judea, that thy disciples there also may see the works which thou dost. For no man doth any thing in secret, but desireth to be publickly known: if thou dost these things, shew thyself to the world.(For neither did his brethren believe on him.) Jesus saith to them, My time is not yet come: your time is always ready. The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth; because I testify of it, that its works are evil. Go ye up to the feast; I go not up to this feast yet; because my time is not yet fully come. Having said these things to them, he abode in Galilee. But when his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were privately. Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him: for some said, He is a good man; others said, Nay; but he seduceth the people. However, no man spake openly of him, for fear of the Jews. Now at the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How doth this man know letters, having never learned? Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man be willing to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory; but he that seekth the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keepeth the law. Why seek ye to kill me? The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil. Who seeketh to kill thee? Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel at it. Moses gave you circumcision, (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers) and ye circumcise a man on the sabbath. If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken: Are ye angry at me, because I intirely healed a man on the sabbath? Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment. Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? And lo he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed, that this is the Christ? Howbeit, we know this man, whence he is: but when Christ cometh, none knoweth whence he is. Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Do ye both know me, and know whence I am? And yet I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me. Then they sought to seize him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? The Pharisees heard the people whispering such things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize him. Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time I am with you, and then I go to him that sent me. Ye shall seek, and shall not find me, and where I am, ye cannot come. Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? What saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me? And where I am, ye cannot come? On the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink. He that believeth on me, out of his belly (as the scripture hath said) shall flow rivers of living water. This he spake of the Spirit, which they who believed on him were to receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. Many of the people therefore hearing this discourse, said, Certainly this is the prophet. Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Doth Christ come out of Galilee? Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was? So there was a division among the people concerning him. And some of them would have seized him; but no man laid hands on him. So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him? The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. The Pharisees answered, Are ye also deceived? Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? But this populace, who know not the law, are accursed. Nicodemus (he that had come to Jesus by night, being one of them) saith to them, Doth our law judge a man before it hear him, and know what he doth? They answered and said to him, Art thou also a Galilean? Search and see, that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. And every man went to his own house. But Jesus went to the mount of Olives. And early in the morning he returned to the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them. And the scribes and Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst, They say to him, Master, this woman was taken actually committing adultery. Now Moses hath commanded us in the law, to stoee such. What therefore sayest t`ou? This they spoke tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground. And as they continued asking him, he raised himself and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. Then stooping down again, he wrote an the ground. But they who heard it, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. Then Jesus raising himself up, and seeing none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She saith, No man, Sir. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and sin no more. Then spake Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not valid. Jesus answered and said to them, Tho' I testify of myself, yet my testimony is valid: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but ye know not whence I came, or whither I go. Ye judge after the flesh: I judge no man. And yet if I judge, my judgment is valid; for I am not alone: but I and the Father that sent me. Even in your law it is written, The testimony of two men is valid. I am one that testify of myself, and the Father that sent me, testifieth of me. Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also. These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. And no man seized him; for his hour was not yet come. Then said Jesus again to them, I go, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin. Whither I go, ye cannot come. The Jews said therefore, Will he kill himself? Because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. Therefore I said, Ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not, that I am, ye shall die in your sins. Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even what I say to you from the beginning. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true, and I speak to the world the things which I have heard from him. They understood not, that he spake to them of the Father. Jesus therefore saith to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that please him. As he spake these words, many believed on him. Then said Jesus to the Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed: And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never inslaved to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily I say unto you, he that practiseth sin, is the slave of sin: And the slave abideth not in the house for ever; but the Son abideth ever. If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye will be free indeed. I know that ye are Abraham's offspring: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my father, and ye do that which ye have heard from your father. They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man who hath told you the truth which I have heard from God. Abraham did not thus. Ye do the deeds of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said to them, If God were your father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth, and come from God. I am come not of myself, but He hath sent me. Why do ye not understand my discourse? Even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and your will is, to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth; for there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it. But because I speak the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me? He that is of God, heareth God's words; ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. Then answered the Jews and said to him, Say we not well, That thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me. I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeketh it and judgeth. Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man keep my word, he shall never see death. Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead and the prophets; yet thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death. Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? The prophets also are dead. Whom makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, He is our God. Yet ye have not known him: but I know him. And if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you; but I know him, and keep his word. Your father Abraham longed to see my day; and he saw it and was glad. Then said the Jews to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus said to them, Verily, verily I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am. Then took they up stones to cast at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple, going thro' the midst of them, and so passed on. And as he passed on, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God might be made manifest thro' him. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night is coming, when no man can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. Having said this, he spit on the ground, and made clay with the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, And said to him, Go wash at the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went therefore, and washed, and came seeing. Then the neighbours and they who had seen him before, when he was blind, said, Is not this he who used to sit begging? Some said, This is he: others, He is like him: but he said, I am he. They said to him, How were thine eyes opened? He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And I went, and washed, and received sight. Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not. They bring to the Pharisees the man who had aforetime been blind.(It was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.) Again the Pharisees also asked him, How he had received his sight? He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and see. Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner, do such miracles? And there was a division among them. They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, for that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, till they had called the parents of him who had received his sight. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see? His parents answered them, and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind. But how he now seeth, we know not, or who hath opened his eyes, we know not. He is of age: ask him; he will speak concerning himself. His parents said this, because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed, That if any man should own him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. Therefore they called a second time the man that had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner. He answered and said, That he is a sinner I know not: one thing I know, that I was blind, and now see. They said to him again, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes? He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hearken: why would ye hear it again? Are ye also willing to be his disciples? Then they reviled him and said, Thou art a disciple of that fellow; but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God spake to Moses; but we know not this fellow, whence he is. The man answered and said to them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not whence he is; altho' he hath opened my eyes! We know that God heareth not sinners; but if a man be a worshiper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. Since the world began it was not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. They answered and said to him, Thou-wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and having found him, he said to him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, Sir, who is he, that I may believe on him? Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that talketh with thee is he. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him. Jesus said, For judgment am I come into the world, that they who see not, may see, and that they who see, may become blind. And some of the Pharisees that were with him heard this, and said to him, Are we blind also? Jesus said to them, If ye had been blind, ye would have had no sin. But now ye say, We see: therefore your sin remaineth. Verily, verily I say to you, he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, he is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door, is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the door-keeper openeth, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he hath led forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. They will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers. This parable spake Jesus to them; but they understood not what things they were which he spake to them. Therefore Jesus said to them again, Verily, verily I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. Whosoever are come before me, are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door; if any one enter in by me, he shall be safe, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and that they may have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep. But the hireling, who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: so the wolf seizeth them, and scattereth the flock. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine;(As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father) and I lay down my life for the sheep. I have also other sheep which are not of this fold: I must bring them likewise, and they will hear my voice, and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No one taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commission have I received of my Father. There was again a division among the Jews, because of these sayings. Many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear ye him? Others said, These are not the words of one that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? Now the feast of the dedication came on at Jerusalem: and it was winter. And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's portico. Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, How long dost thou keep us in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered them, I have told you; yet ye do not believe: the works that I do in my Father's name, they testify of me. But, as I have told you, ye do not believe, because ye are not of my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father, who gave them me, is greater than all; and none shall pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one. Then the Jews again took up stones to stone him. Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? The Jews answered him, We stone thee not for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods? If he call them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken) Say ye of him whom God hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, tho' ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. Therefore they sought again to seize him; but he escaped out of their hand. And he went away again beyond Jordan, to the place where John baptized at first, and there he abode. And many came to him and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. And many believed on him there. Now one Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.(It was that Mary, who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick) Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold he whom thou lovest is sick. Jesus hearing it, said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. So after he had heard that he was sick, he abode still two days in the place where he was. Then after this he saith to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again. The disciples say to him, Master, the Jews but now sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. But if any man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him. Thus he spake, and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go to awake him. Then the disciples said, Lord, if he sleep, he will recover. Jesus spake of his death, but they thought he had spoken of the natural rest in sleep. Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sake I was not there, that ye may believe: but let us go to him. Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. When Jesus came, he found he had been now four days in the tomb.(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.) And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him; but Mary sat in the house. Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. But I know even now, that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, tho' he die, yet shall he live; And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this? She saith to him, Yea, Lord, I believe thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world. Having said this, she went and privately called Mary her sister, saying, The master is come, and calleth for thee. As soon as she heard it, she arose quickly and came to him. Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was at the place where Martha had met him. The Jews then who were with her in the house and comforted her, seeing Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb, to weep there. When Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned deeply, and troubled himself, And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept. Then said the Jews, Behold, how he loved him! And some of them said, Could not this person, who opened the eyes of the blind, have even caused that this man should not have died? Jesus again groaning in himself, cometh to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith to him, Lord, by this time he stinketh; for he hath been buried four days. Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? Then they took away the stone from where the dead lay. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank thee, that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but I spake this, because of the people who stand by, that they may believe thou hast sent me. And having spoken thus, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapt about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go. Many therefore of the Jews who were come to Mary, and had seen the things, which Jesus had done, believed on him. But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. Then the chief priests and elders assembled a council and said, What do we? For this man doth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come and subvert both our place and nation. And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing, Nor consider, it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. He spake not this of himself, but being high-priest that year, he prophesied, that Jesus should die for the nation: And not for that nation only, but that he might also gather into one all the children of God that were scattered abroad. Therefore from that day, they consulted together to put him to death. Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence into the country, near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. And the passover of the Jews was nigh; and many went up to Jerusalem, to purify themselves. Then sought they for Jesus, and said one to another, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast? Now both the chief priests and Pharisees had given order, That if any man knew where he was, he should shew it, that they might apprehend him. Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead. There they made him a supper, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them who sat at table with him. Then Mary, taking a pound of ointment, of very costly spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray him, faith, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and bare what was put therein. Then Jesus said, Let her alone; against the day of my burial hath she kept this. Ye have the poor always with you: but me ye have not always. Now much people of the Jews knew that he was there, and came not only for the sake of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. But the chief priests consulted, how to kill Lazarus also. Because, on his account, many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. The next day, a great multitude who were come to the feast, having heard, that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, Took branches of palm-trees, and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel. And Jesus having got a young ass, rode thereon, as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Sion; behold thy king cometh, sitting on an asses colt. These things his disciples understood not at first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered, that these things were written of of him, and that they had done these things to him. And the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness. For this cause also the multitude went to meet him, because they heard, he had done this miracle. The Pharisees therefore said to each other, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? Behold the world is gone after him. Now among those who came up to worship at the feast, there were certain Greeks. These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew; and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily I say unto you, Unless a grain of wheat that falleth into the ground die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall preserve it to life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honour. Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this cause I came, for this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then a voice came from heaven, I have both glorified, and I will glorify it again. The multitude who stood and heard it, said, It thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.(He spake this, signifying what death he should die.) The people answered him, We have heard out of the law, that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness overtake you, for he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become children of light. These things spake Jesus, and retiring concealed himself from them. But tho' he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him; So that the word of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled which he said, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe, according to what Isaiah said again. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they might not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted, that I might heal them. These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed on him, but they did not confess him, because of the Pharisees, lest they should be put out of the synagogue. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. Jesus said with a loud voice, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, may not continue in darkness. If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him at the last day. For I have not spoken of myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should say, and how I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting; what therefore I speak to you, as the Father hath said to me, so I speak. Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing his hour was come to pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end. And while they were at supper (the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him) Jesus knowing the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come forth from God, and going to God, Riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and taking a towel, girded himself. After that, he poured water into the bason, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel, wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter, who saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said to him, What I do, thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He who hath been bathed, needeth only to wash his feet, and is clean all over: and ye are clean; but not all. For he knew who would betray him: therefore he said, Ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, he took his garments, and sitting down again, said to them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye also may do as I have done to you. Verily, verily I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye, if ye do them. I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen, that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me. Now I tell you before it is done, that, when it is done, ye may believe that I am he. Verily, verily I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. Jesus having said this, was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily I say unto you, one of you will betray me. Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. Now there was lying in the bosom of Jesus, one of the disciples whom Jesus loved. Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, to ask who it was of whom he spake. He then, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him, Lord, who is it? Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the sop when I have dipped it. And having dipped the sop, he giveth it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. And after the sop, then Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, What thou dost, do quickly. Now none at the table knew, why he said this to him. But some thought, as Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need of against the feast, or, Give something to the poor. He then having received the sop, went out immediately. And it was night, when he went out. Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified by him. If God be glorified by him, God will also glorify him with himself, and will shortly glorify him. Little children, yet a little while I am with you: ye shall seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Whither I go ye cannot come, so now I say to you. A new commandment I give you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me hereafter. Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily I say to thee, the cock shall not have crowed, till thou hast denied me thrice. Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God: believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions; if not, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am, ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith to him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way? Jesus saith, I am the way; and the truth, and the life; no man cometh to the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye have known him, and have seen him. Philip saith to him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith to him, Have I been so long with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father: and how sayest thou, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself; and the Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the works. Believe me, because I am in the Father, and the Father in me; but if not, believe me for the sake of the works. Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works which I do, shall he do also; and greater than these shall he do, because I go to my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified thro' the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, to remain with you for ever, Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him. But ye know him; for he remaineth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more: but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Judas (not Iscariot) saith to him, Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world? Jesus answered and said to him, If any man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me. These things have I spoken to you, while I remained with you. But the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye heard me say to you, I go, and come again to you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoyced, because I said, I go to the Father; for my Father is greater than me. And now I have told you, before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye may believe. Hereafter I shall not talk much with with you; for the prince of this world is coming; but he hath nothing in me: But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, so I do. Arise, let us go hence. I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away; and every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth it, that it may bear more fruit. Now ye are pure thro' the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can ye, unless ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him, he beareth much fruit; but, separate from me, ye can do nothing. If any one abide not in me, he is cast out as a branch, and is withered: and they gather and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done for you. Hereby is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit: so shall ye be my disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you. Abide ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. I have spoken these things to you, that my joy might remain in you, and your joy might be full. This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you. No one hath greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you that ye may go and bear fruit, and your fruit may remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. This I command you, that ye love one another. If the world hate you, ye know it hated me, before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do to you, for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. He that hateth me, hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which no other did, they had not had sin: but now have they seen them, and yet hated both me and my Father. So that the word which is written in their law is fulfilled, They hated me without a cause. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me. Ye also testify, because ye have been with me from the beginning. I have told you these things, that ye may not be offended. They will put you out of the synagogues; yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think he doth God service. These things will they do, because they have not known the Father nor me. But I have told you these things, that when the time shall come, ye may remember I told you them. I did not tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you. But now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But because I have told you this, sorrow hath filled your heart. But I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go: for if I go not, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you. And he coming will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: Of sin, because they believe not on me; Of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more; Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say to you; but ye cannot bear them now. But when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak of himself: but whatsoever he shall hear, he will speak; and he will shew you things to come. He will glorify me; for he will take of mine, and shew it you. All things that the Father hath, are mine: therefore I said, He will take of mine, and shew it you. A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. Then some of his disciples said to each other, What is this that he said to us? A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me? and, Because I go to the Father? They said therefore, What is this little while that he speaketh of? We understand not what he saith. Jesus knew they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Ye inquire among you of this, that I said, A little while and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while and ye shall see me. Verily, verily I say unto you, Ye will weep and lament; but the world will rejoice: ye will be sorrowful; but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman when she is in travel, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembreth the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. And ye now therefore have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh from you. And in that day ye shall not question me about any thing. Verily, verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you. Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask (and ye shall receive) that your joy may be full. I have spoken these things to you in parables: but the time is coming, when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but will shew you plainly of the Father. At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you. For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed, that I came forth from God. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and go to the Father. His disciples say to him, Lo now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no parable. Now we are sure thou knowest all things, and needest not that any should question thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. Jesus answered, Ye do now believe. But lo the hour is coming, yea, is already come, that ye shall be scattered every one to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone; for the Father is with me. I have spoken these things to you, that ye may have peace in me. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but take courage: I have overcome the world. These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes and said, Father, the hour is come: glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee on earth. I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, Father, glorify thou me with thyself, with the glory which I had with thee, before the world was. I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou hast given them me, and they have kept thy word. Now they know, that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For I have given them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and have known surely, that I came forth from thee, and they have believed that thou hast sent me. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all things that are mine are thine, and that are thine are mine; and I am glorified by them. And I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep thro' thy name them whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them thro' thy name. Those whom thou hast given me I have guarded, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled. And now I am coming to thee, and I speak these things in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them. I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I do not pray, that thou wouldest take them out of the world, but that thou wouldest keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, as I am not of the world. Sanctify them thro' the truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified thro' the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also who will believe on me thro' their word: That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected in one; and that the world may know, that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me. Father, I will that these also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. Righteous Father, tho' the world hath not known thee, yet I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. And I have declared to them thy name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them. Jesus having spoken these words, went forth with his disciples over the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered and his disciples. And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus had often met there with his disciples. Judas then having received a troop of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and arms. Then Jesus knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them. As soon as he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. He asked them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you, I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go: That the saying might be fulfilled which he had spoke, Of them whom thou hast given me, I have lost none. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right-ear. The servant's name was Malchus. Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up the sword into its scabbard. The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? Then the soldiers, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him; And led him away to Annas first (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.) Caiaphas was he who had counselled the Jews, that it was expedient one man should die for the people. Now Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple. That disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. But Peter stood at the door without: therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spake to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. Then saith the maid, who kept the door, to Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. And the servants and officers, having made a fire of coals (for it was cold) stood and warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them and warmed himself. Then the high priest asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I was continually teaching in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort, and in secret have I said nothing. Why askest thou me? Ask them that heard me, what I said to them: behold, they know what I said. When he had said thus, one of the officers, who stood by, gave Jesus a blow, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? Jesus answered, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?(Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.) Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not. One of the servants of the high priest (being kinsman to him whose ear Peter had cut off) saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? Peter denied again, and immediately the cock crew. Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's palace, and it was early: and they went not into the palace themselves, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man? They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him to thee. Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: So the saying of Jesus was fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. Then Pilate returned into the palace, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this of thyself? or did others tell it thee of me? Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, even the chief priests, have delivered thee to me. What hast thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I might not be delivered to the Jews: but my kingdom is not from hence. Pilate said to him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest. I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice. Pilate saith to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find no fault in him. But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release to you the king of the Jews? Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged him. And the soldiers having platted a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and put on him a purple robe, And said, Hail, king of the Jews. And they smote him on the cheeks. Pilate went out again, and saith to them, Lo, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know, I find no fault in him. Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe, And he saith to them, Behold the man. But when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Take ye him and crucify him; for I find no fault in him. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. When Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid, And returned into the palace and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Then Pilate saith to him, Speakest thou not to me? Knowest thou not, that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power over me, unless it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin. Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not a friend to Cesar. Whosoever maketh himself a king, opposeth Cesar. Pilate hearing this saying, brought Jesus forth, and sat on the judgment seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha;(It was then the preparation of the passover, and about the third hour:) And saith to the Jews, Behold your king. But they cried out, Away with him, away with him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar. Then delivered he him to them, to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away. And he bearing his cross, went forth to the place, called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha: Where they crucified him, and two others with him, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst. And Pilate wrote an inscription also, and put it on the cross: and the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. Many of the Jews read this inscription; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. Then said the chief priests to Pilate, Write not, the king of the Jews; but that he said, I am the king of the Jews. Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written. And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his vesture: now the vesture was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore one to another, Let us not rent it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and cast lots for my vesture. These things therefore the soldiers did. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene. Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son. Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. After this, Jesus knowing, that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar. And filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a stalk of hyssop, they put it to his mouth. When Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and bowing the head, he gave up the Ghost. Now because it was the preparation, lest the bodies should remain upon the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a great day) the Jews besought Pilate, that their legs might be broken, and they might be taken away. Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him. But coming to Jesus, when they saw he was dead already, they brake not his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and forthwith there came out blood and water. And he that saw, hath testified it, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye may believe. For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of it shall not be broken. And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they have pierced. And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews) asked Pilate leave, to take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus. And Nicodemus also came (who at first had come to Jesus by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pounds. So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which no man had ever been laid. There therefore they laid Jesus, because of the preparation -day of the Jews; for the sepulchre was nigh. The first day of the week, cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, to the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. Then Peter went out and the other disciple, and ran toward the sepulchre. They both ran together: but the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And stooping down, he saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but folded up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, went in; and he saw and believed. For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went home again. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down into the sepulchre, And seeth two angels in white sitting, where the body of Jesus had laid, one at the head, and one at the feet. And they said to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. And having said this, she turned herself back, and seeth Jesus standing, but knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She supposing him to be the gardiner, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith to her, Mary! She turning, saith to him, Rabboni; that is, Master. Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her. The same day, the first day of the week, at evening, the doors being shut, where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace be unto you. And having said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you. As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And having said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. But Thomas called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see the print of the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the prints of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: happy are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. And Jesus wrought many other miracles also, in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life thro' his name. After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; he manifested himself thus. There were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. Simon Peter saith to them, I go a fishing. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went out and entered into the vessel, but caught nothing that night. When the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. And he said to them, Cast your net on the right side of the vessel, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter hearing that it was the Lord, girt on his upper coat (for he was stript) and threw himself into the sea. And the other disciples came in the vessel (for they were not far from land, about two hundred cubits) drawing the net, full of fishes. When they came ashore, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have taken now. Simon Peter went on board, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three; and tho' there were so many, the net was not broken. Jesus saith to them, Come ye and dine. And none of the disciples presumed to ask him, Who art thou? Knowing that it was the Lord. Jesus then cometh and taketh bread, and giveth to them, and fish likewise. This was the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead. When they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me more than these do? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again, the second time, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep. He saith to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep. Verily, verily I say unto thee, when thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself, and walk whither thou wouldest: but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. This he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And having said this, he saith to him, Follow me. Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee? Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, what shall this man do? Jesus saith to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, That he should not die: but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is it to thee? This is the disciple, who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true. And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were to be written particularly, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that were written.The former treatise have I composed, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, Until the day he was taken up, after having thro' the Holy Ghost given commandment to the apostles, whom he had chosen: To whom also he presented himself alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen by them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. And having assembled them together, he commanded them, not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard from me. For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence. And when they were come together, they asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? But he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, the Holy Ghost being come upon you, and shall be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth. And having spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight. And while they were stedfastly looking up to heaven, as he went up, behold two men, in white apparel, stood by them, Who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as ye have seen him going into heaven. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey. And when they were come in, they went up into the upper-room, where both Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James tarried. These all continued unanimously in prayer and supplication with the women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brethren. And in these days, Peter standing up in the midst of the disciples, (the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty) said, Men, brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spake before by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus. For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling down on his face, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out. And it was known to all that dwell at Jerusalem, so that that field is called, in their own tongue, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His office let another take. Wherefore of these men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus was going in and out over us, Beginning from the baptism of John, till the day that he was taken up from us, one must be ordained, to be a witness with us of his resurrection. And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, shew which of these two thou hast chosen, To take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, to go to his own place. And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there was a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, violent wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them distinct tongues, as of fire; and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together and were confounded, because every man heard them speaking in his own language. And they were amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how hear we every one, in our own native language? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Africk about Cyrene, and Roman sojourners, (Jews and Proselytes) Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonderful works of God? And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What can this mean? But others mocking, said, They are full of sweet wine. Then Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words. These are not drunken as ye suppose for it is but the third hour of the day. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel, And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: And in those days I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and upon my handmaids, and they shall prophecy. And I will shew prodigies in heaven above, and signs on earth beneath, blood and fire, and vapour of smoke, The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the day of the Lord, the great and illustrious day, come. But whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved. Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man pointed out to you of God, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as yourselves also know: Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands, have crucified and slain: Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, as it was not possible that he should be held under it. For David speaketh concerning him, I have seen the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right-hand, that I may not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue exulteth; yea, and my flesh shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy by thy countenance. Men and brethren, I may say to you freely of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is among us to this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, That of the fruit of his loins one should sit on his throne, He foreseeing this, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in Hades, neither did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God hath raised up, whereof all we are witnesses. Being therefore exalted by the right-hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. For David is not ascended into the heavens; but he saith himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right-hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, That God hath made this Jesus whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ. And hearing this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do? And Peter said, Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation. Then they, gladly receiving his word, were baptized; and there were added to them that day about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfast in the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, and the prayers. And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles. And all that believed were together, and had all things common, And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, as any one had need. And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking the bread at home, they ate their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added daily to the church those who were saved. Now Peter and John went up together into the temple, at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. And a certain man, lame from his mother's womb, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that were entering into the temple, Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked an alms. And Peter, looking stedfastly upon him, with John, said, Look on us. And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something of them. Then said Peter, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And taking him by the right-hand, he lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle-bones were strengthened, And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. And all the people saw him walking and praising God. And they knew him, that this was he who had sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple, and were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had befallen him. And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them, in the portico that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. And Peter seeing it, answered the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? Or, why do ye fix your eyes on us, as if by our own power or piety, we had made this man to walk? The God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and renounced him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to release him. But ye renounced the holy one and the just, and desired a murderer to be granted you. But ye killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses. And his name, thro' faith in his name, hath strengthened this man, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is by him, hath given him this perfect soundness, in the presence of you all. And now, brethren, I know that thro' ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. But God hath thus fulfilled the things which he foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer. Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, And he may send to you Jesus Christ, who was before appointed, Whom heaven must receive, till the times of the restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets. For Moses truly said to the fathers, The Lord your God shall raise you up a prophet of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say to you. And every soul who will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed, whosoever have spoken, have also foretold these days. Ye are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. God having raised up his Son, hath sent him to you first, to bless you, by turning every one of you from your iniquities. And as they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Saducees came upon them, Being grieved that they had healed the lame man, and preached thro' Jesus the resurrection from the dead. And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold till the next day: for it was now evening. But many of them who had heard the word, believed. And the number of the men was about five thousand. And on the morrow were gathered together at Jerusalem their rulers, and elders, and scribes, And Annas the high-priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high-priest. And having set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? Then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, If we are examined this day, of the benefit done to the impotent man, by what means he is healed, Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, by him doth this man stand before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the corner. And there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. And seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and understanding that they were illiterate and uneducated men, they marvelled, and took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. And beholding the man who had been healed, standing with them, they had nothing to say against it. But having ordered them to go out of the council, they conferred among themselves, saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a signal miracle hath been wrought by them, is manifest to all that dwell at Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. Yet that it spread no farther among the people, let us severely threaten them, that they speak no more to any man in this name. And having called them, they charged them, Not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answering, said to them, Whether it be righteous in the sight of God, to obey you rather than God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things, which we have seen and heard. And having threatened them again, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for they all glorified God for that which was done. For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought, was above forty years old. And being let go, they went to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art the God who madest heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: Who saidst by the mouth of thy servant David, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. For of a truth, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, To do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel before determined to be done. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and give thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness, While thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done thro' the name of thy holy child Jesus. And while they were praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake the word of God with boldness. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one soul: and not so much as one said that ought of the things which he had, was his own, but they had all things common. And the apostles gave forth their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power, and great grace was upon them all. For neither was there any one among them that lacked: for whosoever were possessors of houses or lands sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, And laid them down at the feet of the apostles, and distribution was made to every one, according as any had need. And Joses, by the apostles surnamed Barnabas, which is, being interpreted, a son of consolation, a Levite, a Cyprian by birth, Having an estate, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles. But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and, bringing a certain part, laid it at the feet of the apostles. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart, to lie to the Holy Ghost? And to keep back part of the price of the land? While it remained, did it not remain thine? And when it was sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God. And Ananias hearing these words, fell down and expired; and great fear came on all that heard these things. And the young men arose, wound him up, and carrying him out, buried him. And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. And Peter said to her, Tell me, if ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. And Peter said to her, Why have ye agreed together, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. And immediately she fell at his feet and expired; and the young men coming in, found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her by her husband. And great fear came upon all the church, and upon all that heard these things. And many signs and wonders were wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles: (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico: And none of the rest durst join themselves to them; but the people magnified them, And multitudes both of men and women believing were the more added to the Lord:) So that they brought out the sick along the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that even the shadow of Peter coming by, might overshadow some of them. And multitudes also of the cities round about, came together to Jerusalem, bringing persons sick and troubled by unclean spirits; and they were all healed. But the high priest arising, and all that were with him, which was the sect of the Saducees, were filled with zeal, And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them into the common prison. But an angel of the Lord opened the prison-doors, by night, and bringing them forth, said, Go, stand and speak in the temple the words of this life. And hearing this, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, called together the council, even the whole senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison, to have them brought, But when the officers came, they found them not in the prison; and returning they said, Truly we found the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing before the doors; but having opened them, we found no man within. When the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them, what this should be? Then came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison, are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. Then the captain going with the officers brought them, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned. And having brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them, Did not we strictly command you, Not to teach in this name? And lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would bring the blood of this man upon us. Then Peter and the other apostles answering said, We ought to obey God rather than man. The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree. Him hath God exalted, a Prince and a Saviour with his right-hand, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses of these things, and also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. When they heard this, they gnashed their teeth, and took counsel to slay them. But a certain Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honour by all the people, rising up in the council, ordered, to put the apostles out a little space: And said to them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves, what ye are about to do, touching these men. For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred, who was slain, and all who hearkened to him were scattered and came to nothing. After this man rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the inrolment, and drew away much people after him; he also perished, and all who had hearkened to him were dispersed. And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, and take heed lest ye be found even fighting against God. And to him they agreed. And having called the apostles, and scourged them, they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. And they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ daily, in the temple, and from house to house. Now in these days, the disciples multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. Then the twelve calling the multitude of the disciples together, said, It is not right, that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. Therefore, brethren, look out from among you seven men of good report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we will set over this business. But we will constantly attend to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. And the saying pleased the whole multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch: Whom they set before the apostles, and having prayed, they laid their hands upon them. And the word of God grew, and the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem greatly: and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. But there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called that of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake. Then they suborned men who said, We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and against God. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and coming upon him, dragged him away, and brought him to the council, And set up false witnesses who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against the holy place and the law. For we have heard him say, That Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and change the rites which Moses delivered us. And all that were sitting in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face, as the face of an angel. Then said the high priest, Are these things so? And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, And said to him, Come out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into a land, which I will shew thee. And coming out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran. And from thence, after his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not to set his foot on; yet he promised to give it him for a possession, even to his seed after him, when he had no child. And God spake thus: That his seed should sojourn in a strange land, (and they will inslave them and treat them evil) four hundred years. And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage, will I judge, saith God. And after that, they shall come forth, and serve me in this place. And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day, and Isaac Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. And the patriachs moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt; but God was with him, And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharoah king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt, and all his house. Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers found no sustenance. But Jacob hearing there was corn in Egypt, sent our fathers first. And the second time, Joseph was made known to his brethren, and Joseph's kindred was discovered to Pharoah. Then Joseph sending, called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls. So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he and our fathers, And were carried over to Shechem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money, of Hamor, the father of Shechem. And when the time of the promise which God had sworn to Abraham drew near, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, Till another king arose, who had not known Joseph. He dealing subtilely with our kindred, evil intreated our fathers, by causing their male infants to be exposed, that they might not live. In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding beautiful, who was nursed three months in his father's house. And when he was exposed, Pharoah's daughter took him up, and brought him up for her own son. And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. But when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel. And seeing one wronged, he defended and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian. For he supposed his brethren would have understood, that God would deliver them by his hand; but they understood it not. And the next day, he shewed himself to them, as they were quarrelling, and would have persuaded them to peace, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren: why do ye wrong one another? But he that wronged his neighbour thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday? And Moses fled at that saying, and was a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons. And forty years being expired, the angel of the Lord appeared to him, in the wilderness, in a flame of fire in a bush. And Moses seeing it, wondered at the sight. But as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came to him, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold. Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet; for the place where thou standest is holy ground. I have surely seen the evil treatment of my people which is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come; I will send thee into Egypt. This Moses, whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a prince and a judge, the same did God send, to be a ruler and a deliverer, by the hand of the Angel, who appeared to him in the bush. He brought them out, doing wonders and signs, in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years. This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, The Lord your God will raise you up, out of your brethren, a prophet like me: him shall ye hear. This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the Angel who spake to him in mount Sinai, and with our fathers; who received the living oracles to give to us: Whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back into Egypt, Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands. And God turned and gave them up, to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Have ye offered victims and sacrifices to me, for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? Yea, ye took up the shrine of Molock, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon. Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, as he had appointed who spake to Moses, to make it according to the model which he had seen: Which also our fathers having received, brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out from the face of our fathers, till the days of David: Who found favour with God, and petitioned to find an habitation for the God of Jacob. But Solomon built him an house. Yet the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet, Heaven is my throne, and earth my footstool. What house will ye build me, saith the Lord: or What is the place of my rest? Hath not my hand made all these things? Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers, so do ye. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them that shewed before of the coming of the Just One, of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: Who have received the law by the administration of angels, and have not kept it. And hearing these things, they were cut to the heart, and gnashed their teeth upon him. But he being full of the Holy Ghost, looking up stedfastly to heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right-hand of God: And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right-hand of God. Then they cried with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord, And casting him out of the city, stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen, invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And having said this, he fell asleep: And Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church, which was in Jerusalem. And they were all scattered abroad through the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him. But Saul made havock of the church, entring into every house, and haling men and women, committed them to prison. Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went every where, preaching the word. And Philip coming down to a city of Samaria, preached Christ to them. And the people with one accord gave heed to the things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many that had them, and many sick of the palsy and lame were healed. And there was great joy in that city. But a certain man, named Simon, had been before in the city, using magic, and astonishing the Samaritans, saying, that he was some great one. To whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. They gave heed to him, because he had a long time astonished them with witchcraft. But when they believed Philip, preaching the things of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. And Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he continued with Philip, and was astonished, beholding the signs and mighty miracles which were done. And the apostles who were at Jerusalem, hearing that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John: Who being come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost. For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. And Simon seeing that thro' laying on of the hands of the apostles the Holy Ghost was given, offered them money, Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought to purchase the gift of God with money. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee. For I see, thou art in the gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity. And Simon answering said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things, which ye have spoken, may come upon me. They then, having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned toward Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. And an angel of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south by the way leading down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went. And lo an Ethiopian, an eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship, Was returning, and sitting in his chariot, read the prophet Isaiah. Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip running to him, heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? And he said, How can I, unless some one guide me? And he desired Philip to come up, and sit with him. The portion of scripture which he was reading, was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so he opened not his mouth. In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? For his life is taken from the earth. And the eunuch answering Philip, said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip opening his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached Jesus to him. And as they went on the way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said, Behold water: what hindereth me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayst. And he answering said, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down to the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing. But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Cesarea. But Saul still breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, going to the high priest, Desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, he might bring both men and women bound to Jerusalem. And as he journeyed, he drew near Damascus; and suddenly there shone about him a light from heaven. And falling to the earth, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee, to kick against the goads. And he trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. And the men that journeyed with him stood astonished, hearing a noise, but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and his eyes being opened, he saw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank. And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold I am here, Lord. And the Lord said to him, Arise, go into the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas, for one named Saul of Tarsus; for behold, he is praying. And he hath seen in a vision a man, named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he may recover his sight. But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem. And here also he hath authority from the chief priests, to bind all that call on thy name. But the Lord said unto him, Go: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before nations and kings, and the children of Israel. For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake. And Ananias went and entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord hath sent me, Jesus who appeared to thee in the way thou camest, that thou mayst recover thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately as it were scales fell from his eyes, and he recovered his sight, and arose and was baptized. And having received food, he was strengthened. And he was certain days with the disciples in Damascus: And straightway he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. But all that heard were amazed, and said, Is not this he who destroyed those that call on this name at Jerusalem? And came hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests? But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ. And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted together to kill him. But their lying in wait was known by Saul: and they guarded the gates day and night to kill him. Then the disciples, taking him by night, let him down by the wall in a basket. And coming to Jerusalem, he endeavoured to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. But Barnabas taking him, brought him to the apostles, and declared to them, How he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus, in the name of Jesus. And he was with them, coming in and going out at Jerusalem. And preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, he disputed with the Hellenists: but they attempted to kill him: Which the brethren knowing, brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. Then the church through all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria had peace: and being built up, and walking in the fear of God, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, was multiplied. And as Peter passed through all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda. And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, being ill of a palsy. And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee. Arise and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord. Now there was at Joppa, a certain disciple, named Tabitha, which is by interpretation Dorcas; this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. And in those days she was sick and died; whom having washed, they laid in an upper chamber. And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples hearing Peter was there, sent to him two men, desiring that he would not delay to come to them. Then Peter arose and went with them; whom being come, they brought into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. But Peter, having put them all out, kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up. And giving her his hand, and having called the saints and widows, he presented her alive. And it was known through all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord. And he tarried many days in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner. And there was a certain man in Cesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that called the Italian band, A devout man, and fearing God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. He saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of the Lord coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius. And looking stedfastly on him, and being affrighted, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thy alms are come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. And when the angel who spake to him was departed, he called two of his houshold-servants, and a devout soldier, of them that waited on him continually. And having declared to them all these things, he sent them to Joppa. On the morrow, as they journeyed and drew nigh to the city, Peter went up on the house-top, to pray, about the sixth hour. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel like a great sheet, tied at the four corners, descending to him, and let down on the earth: Wherein were all four-footed creatures of the earth, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And a voice came to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat. But Peter said, In no wise, Lord: for I have never eaten any thing common or unclean. And the voice came to him again, the second time, What God hath purified, call not thou common. This was done thrice, and the vessel was taken up again to heaven. Now while Peter doubted in himself, what the vision he had seen should mean, behold the men sent by Cornelius, having inquired out Simon's house, stood at the gate, And calling asked, Whether Simon, surnamed Peter, lodged there? While Peter was musing on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men seek thee. Arise therefore and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them. Then Peter going down to the men, said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: for what cause are ye come? And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and fearing God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned of God by an holy angel, to send for thee to his house, and to hear words from thee. And he invited them in and lodged them. And the next day, Peter went away with them; and certain brethren from Joppa went with him. And the day following they entered into Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and near friends. And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet, worshiped him. But Peter raised him up saying, Arise: I myself also am a man. And as he talked with him, he went in and found many come together. And he said to them, Ye know it is unlawful for a Jew to join with or come to one of another nation; but God hath shewed me, to call no man common or unclean. Therefore being sent for, I came without gain-saying. I ask therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me? And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting till this hour, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house, and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing, And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are remembred before God. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner by the sea, who being come, shall speak to thee. Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well in coming. Now therefore we are all present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee by God. Then Peter opening his mouth, said, I perceive of a truth that God is not a respecter of persons: But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted by him. This is the word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching the glad tidings of peace through Jesus Christ; He is Lord of all. Ye know the word which was published through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached: How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom yet they slew and hanged on a tree. Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;(Not to all the people, but to witnesses, chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him) after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us, to proclaim to the people, and to testify, that it is he who is ordained by God the Judge of the living and the dead. To him give all the prophets witness, that every one who believeth in him, shall receive forgiveness of sins through his name. While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all that were hearing the word. And the believers of the circumcision, as many as came with Peter, were amazed, that the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out on the Gentiles also. For they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost, even as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they prayed him to tarry certain days. Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard, that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision debated with him, saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. Then Peter beginning, laid all things before them in order, saying, I was praying in the city of Joppa, and being in a trance, I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by the four corners, and it came even to me: On which looking stedfastly, I observed and saw four-footed creatures of the earth, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise Peter, kill and eat. But I said, In no wise, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth. And the voice from heaven answered me again, What God hath purified, call not thou common. This was done thrice, and all were drawn up again into heaven. And behold immediately three men stood at the house where I was, sent from Cesarea to me. And the Spirit bad me go with them, doubting nothing: these six brethren also went with me, and we entered into the man's house. And he told us, how he had seen an angel standing in his house, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call Simon, surnamed Peter, Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy family may be saved. And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. If then God gave to them the same gift as even to us, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that could withstand God? When they heard these things, they were quiet, and glorified God, saying, Then God hath given to the Gentiles also repentance unto life. Now they who had been scattered abroad by the distress which arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching to none but Jews only. And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who coming into Antioch, spake to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number believed and turned to the Lord. And tidings of these things came to the ears of the church that was in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas, to go to Antioch: Who coming and seeing the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, to cleave unto the Lord with full purpose of heart. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and faith. And a considerable multitude was added to the Lord. Then went he to Tarsus to seek Saul; and having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught a considerable multitude: and the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch. In those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. And one of them, named Agabus stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine through all the world; which also came to pass under Claudius Cesar. Then the disciples determined to send relief, every one according to his ability, to the brethren who dwelt in Judea: Which also they did, sending it to the elders, by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. About that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict a certain of the church. And he slew James, the brother of John, with the sword. And perceiving it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to take Peter also.(Then were the days of unleavened bread. ) Whom having apprehended, he put in prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him forth to the people after the passover. So Peter was kept in the prison; but continual prayer was made to God by the church for him. And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood over him, and light shined in the house: and smiting Peter on the side he waked him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals; and he did so. And he saith to him, Throw thy garment about thee, and follow me. And going out, he followed him. And he knew not, that it was real which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision. When they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city, which opened to them of its own accord: and going out, they went on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him. And Peter coming to himself, said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. And having considered, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together praying. And as he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And knowing Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but running in, told them, that Peter stood before the gate. And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed, it was so. Then they said, It is his angel. But Peter continued knocking. And opening the door, they saw him and were astonished. But he beckoning to them with his hand, to be silent, declared to them, How the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Shew these things to James and to the brethren. And going out, he went to another place. Now when it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, What was become of Peter? And Herod having sought for him, and not found him, examined the guard, and commanded them to be put to death. And going down from Judea to Cesarea, he abode there. And he was highly incensed against them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and having gained Blastus, the king's chamberlain, sued for peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country. And on a set day, Herod arrayed in royal apparel, and sitting on his throne, made an oration to them. And the people shouted, It is the voice of God, and not of a man. And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory; and being eaten by worms, he expired. But the word of God grew and multiplied. And Barnabas and Saul, having fulfilled their service, returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, surnamed Mark. Now there were in the church that was at Antioch, certain prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. And as they were ministring to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them. Then having fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. So being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, they went down to Seleucia, and from thence sailed to Cyprus. And being at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they had also John for their attendant. And having gone through the whole isle to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus. Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He calling to him Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God. But Elymas, the magician (so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. Then Saul (who is also called Paul ) filled with the Holy Ghost, and fixing his eyes upon him, said, O full of all guile and all mischief, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee; and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately a mist and darkness fell upon him, and going about, he sought some to lead him. Then the proconsul, seeing what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. And Paul and those with him loosing from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John withdrawing from them, returned to Jerusalem. And departing from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia; and going into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, they sat down. And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the chief of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation to the people, speak. Then Paul standing, and waving his hand, said, Ye men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken. The God of this people chose our fathers, and raised the people, while sojourning in the land of Egypt, and brought them out of it with an uplifted arm. And he suffered their manners in the wilderness, about the space of forty years. And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot, about four hundred and fifty years. And after that, he gave them judges, until Samuel the prophet. And afterward they desired a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years. And having removed him, he raised up to them David for their king, to whom also bearing witness he said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, who will do all my will. Of this man's seed hath God, according to his promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus; John having first preached before his coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But behold one cometh after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose. Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, neither knowing him, nor the sayings of the prophets, which are read very sabbath-day, have fulfilled them, in condemning him. And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate, that he might be put to death. And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, taking him down from the tree, they laid him in a sepulchre. But God raised him from the dead. And he was seen many days by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people. And we declare to you glad tidings, that the promise which was made to the fathers, God hath fulfilled this to us their children, in raising up Jesus: as it is written also in the second Psalm, Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. And because he raised him up from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he spake thus, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also in another Psalm, Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy one to see corruption. Now David, having served the will of God in his generation, fell asleep, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption. But he whom God raised, did not see corruption. Be it known unto you therefore, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins. And by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken in the prophets. Behold ye despisers, and wonder and perish. For I work a work in your days, a work which ye will in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you. And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought them, that these words might be spoken to them on the sabbath between. And when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them, persuaded them, to continue in the grace of God. And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together, to hear the word of God. But the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with zeal, and spake against the things spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. Then Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly, said, It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold! we turn to the Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set Thee for a light of the Gentiles, that Thou mightest be for salvation to the ends of the earth. And the Gentiles hearing it were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed. And the word of the Lord was spread through all that country. But the Jews stirred up the devout, honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. And they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and went to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost. And in Iconium they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of the Jews and Greeks believed. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil-affected against the brethren. Yet they abode a long time speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. And when there was an assault both of the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, Being aware of it, they fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, And preached the gospel there. And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, having been a cripple from his mother's womb, who had never walked. This man heard Paul speaking; who fixing his eyes upon him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. But the multitude, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voice, saying, in the Lycaonian language, The gods are come down to us, in the likeness of men. And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, and with the multitude, would have sacrificed. But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard it, they rent their clothes and sprang in among the people, crying out and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach to you, to turn from these vanities unto the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are therein: Who, in times past, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways: Yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, giving rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food and gladness. And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitude from sacrificing to them. But there came thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the multitude, and having stoned Paul, dragged him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose and went into the city; and the next day, he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. And having preached the gospel to that city, and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch, Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith; and that we must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom of God. And when they had ordained them presbyters in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed. And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia, And having preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, And thence sailed back to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God, for the work which they had fulfilled. And being come and having gathered the church together, they related all that God had done with them, and that he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. And they abode there a long time with the disciples. But certain men coming down from Judea taught the brethren, Except ye be circumcised, after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had had no small contention and debate with them, they determined, that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them, should go up to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem about this question. And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren. And being come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles, and elders; and they declared all things which God had done with them. But there rose up, said they, certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, That we ought to circumcise them, and command them to keep the law of Moses. And the apostles and elders came together, to consider of this matter. And after much debate, Peter rose up and said to them, Brethren, ye know, that God long ago made choice among us, that the Gentiles should by my mouth hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving the Holy Ghost to them, even as also to us. And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Now therefore why endeavour ye to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe, that through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we shall be saved, even as they. Then all the multitude kept silence and hearkened to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought by them among the Gentiles. And when they held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken to me. Simon hath declared, how God at first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written, After this I will return and build again the fallen tabernacle of David; I will build again the ruins thereof, and will set it up, That the residue of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles on whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doth these things. Known unto God are all his works from eternity. Wherefore my sentence is, That we trouble not them who from among the Gentiles turn to God. But that we write to them, to abstain from things offered to idols and fornication, and things strangled and blood. For Moses hath of old time them that preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every sabbath-day. Then it seemed good to the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, Judas, surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren, Writing thus by their hand, The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren salute the brethren who are of the Gentiles, in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia. Forasmuch as we have heard, that some who came from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law, whom we commanded not. It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send to you chosen men, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, Men that have hazarded their lives, for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things by mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, that no further burden be laid upon you than these necessary things, To abstain from meats offered to idols and blood, and things strangled and fornication; from which keeping yourselves ye will do well. Fare ye well. So being dismissed they came to Antioch, and having assembled the multitude, they delivered the epistle: Which having read, they rejoiced for the consolation. And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted and confirmed the brethren with many words. And after they had tarried a space, they were dismissed with peace by the brethren to the apostles. But it seemed good to Silas, to remain there. Paul also and Barnabas abode in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also the word of the Lord. And after certain days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit the brethren in every city, where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do. And Barnabas counselled, to take with them John, surnamed Mark. But Paul thought it not right to take with them him, who had departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. And there was a sharp contention, so that they parted from each other; and Barnabas taking Mark with him, sailed away to Cyprus; But Paul having chose Silas, departed, being recommended by the brethren to the grace of God. And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. And he came down to Derbe and Lystra. And behold a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek: Who was well reported of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium. Him Paul would have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew his father, that he was a Greek. And as they went through the cities, they gave them the decrees, which were determined by the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem to keep. And the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily. And having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, being forbid by the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, Coming to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit suffered them not. And passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. And a vision appeared to Paul by night: a man of Macedonia stood and intreated him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, assuredly inferring, that the Lord called us to preach the gospel to them. Sailing therefore from Troas, we ran with a strait course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis: And from thence to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony. And we abode in that city certain days. And on the sabbath we went out of the city, by the river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and sitting down, we spake to the women who were come together. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, a worshiper of God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to assent to the things which were spoken by Paul. And when she was baptized and her family, she intreated us saying, Since ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there. And she constrained us. And as we were going to prayer, a certain damsel, possest by a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by prophesying. She following after Paul and us, cried out, saying, These men are servants of the most high God, who declare to us the way of salvation. And this she did for many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out of her. And he came out the same hour. But when her owners saw, that the hope of their gain was gone, laying hold of Paul and Silas, they dragged them into the market-place to the magistrates, And having brought them to the pretors, they said, These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city, And teach customs, which it is not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive, neither to observe. And the multitude rose up together against them; and the pretors tearing off their garments, commanded to beat them with rods. And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: Who having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks. But at midnight Paul and Silas having prayed, sung an hymn to God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. And the jailor awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, supposing the prisoners were fled. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm; for we are all here. Then he called for lights, and sprang in, and trembling, fell down before Paul and Silas. And having brought them out he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved and thy houshold. And they spake the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house. And taking them that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his houshold. And having brought them up into his house, he set a table before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with his whole house. And when it was day, the pretors sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go. And the jailor told these things to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publickly, uncondemned, and have cast us into prison, who are Romans: and do they now thrust us out privately? Nay verily: but let them come themselves and conduct us out. And the serjeants reported these words to the pretors; and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans. And they came and comforted them; and conducting them out, requested that they would depart from the city. And coming out of the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed. And taking their journey through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. And Paul, according to his custom, went in to them, and three sabbath-days discoursed with them from the scriptures, Opening them and evincing, That Christ ought to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and that this is the Christ, even Jesus, whom I declare unto you. And some of them believed, and were joined to Paul and Silas, and a great number of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the principal women. But the Jews who believed not, filled with zeal, taking to them some of the mean and profligate fellows, and making a mob, set all the city in an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, sought to bring them out to the people. But not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying aloud, These men, that have turned the world upside down, are come hither also: Whom Jason hath privately received; and all these men act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, that there is another king, one Jesus. And they alarmed the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. However having taken security of Jason and of the rest, they let them go. But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea, who coming thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews. These were more ingenuous than those of Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, and daily searching the scriptures, whether those things were so? Therefore many of them believed, and of the Grecian women of considerable rank, and of the men not a few. But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea also, they came thither likewise, and stirred up the multitude. Then the brethren sent away Paul immediately, to go as it were to the sea; but Silas and Timothy continued there. And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens, and having received an order to Silas and Timothy, to come to him with all speed, they departed. Now, while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry. He therefore discoursed in the synagogue to the Jews and the devout persons, and in the market-place daily to those whom he met with. Then some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers incountered him: and some said, What would this babler say? Others, he seemeth to be a proclaimer of strange gods; because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection. And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, which is spoken by thee? For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears; we would therefore know, what these things mean?(For all the Athenians, and the strangers sojourning there, spent their time in nothing else, but telling or hearing some new thing.) Then Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that ye are greatly addicted to the worship of invisible powers. For as I passed along and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar, on which was inscribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD: him therefore whom ye worship without knowing him, I proclaim unto you. God who made the world and all things therein, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands. Neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed any thing, he himself giving to all life and breath, and all things. And he hath made of one the whole nation of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation: That they might seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us. For in him we live and move, and have our being; as certain likewise of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead is like gold or silver, or stone, graven by art and contrivance of man. The times of ignorance indeed God overlooked; but he now commandeth all men every where to repent. Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by the man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. And when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked: but others said, We will hear thee again concerning this. So Paul departed from among them. Howbeit, some clave to him and believed: among whom was even Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. After these things, Paul departing from Athens, came to Corinth. And finding a certain Jew name Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy with Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome) he went to them. And as he was of the same trade, he abode with them and wrought, for they were tent-makers by trade. And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and Greeks. And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews, that Jesus was the Christ. But when they set themselves in opposition and blasphemed, he shook his raiment and said to them, Your blood is upon your own head; I am pure: from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles. And going thence, he went into the house of one named Justus, one that worshiped God, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue. And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized. Then the Lord said to Paul by a vision, in the night, Fear not, but speak and hold not thy peace: For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city. And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made an assault with one consent upon Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat, Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were an act of injustice or wicked licentiousness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you. But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of these matters. And he drove them away from the judgment-seat. Then they all took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things. And Paul still continued many days; and then taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shaved his head at Cenchrea; for he had a vow. And he came to Ephesus, and left him there; but he himself going into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews. But though they intreated him to tarry longer with them, he consented not: But took his leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem, but I will return to you again, if God will. And he set sail from Ephesus. And landing at Cesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch. And having spent some time there, he departed, and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples. Now a certain Jew, Apollos by name, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John. And he spake boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla hearing him, took him to their house, and explained to him the way of God more perfectly. And when he was desirous to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who being come thither, greatly helped through grace them that had believed. For he earnesty debated with the Jews in publick, shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ. Now while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper parts, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples, He said to them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost, since ye believed? And they said to him, Nay, we have not so much as heard, Whether there be any Holy Ghost. He said to them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism. And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe on him that was to come after him, that is on Jesus. And hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And Paul laying his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied. And they were in all about twelve men. And going into the synagogue, he spake boldly, for three months discoursing and evincing the things concerning the kingdom of God. But when some were hardened, and would not believe, but spake reproachfully of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. And this was done for the space of two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord. And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul, So that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them. And some of the vagabond Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus, over those who had evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jewish chief priest, who did this. But the evil spirit answering said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaping upon them, and getting the mastery of them, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. And this was known to all both Jews and Greeks dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. And many of those who believed came, confessing and openly declaring their deeds. Many also of those who had practised curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all men, and they computed the value of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. So powerfully did the word of God grow and prevail. After these things were ended, Paul purposed in spirit, having passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must see Rome also. And having sent two of those who ministred to him, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself staid in Asia for a season. And about that time, there arose no small tumult concerning the way. For a man named Demetrius, a silver smith, who made silver shrines of Diana, procured no small gain to the artificers: Whom having gathered together, with the workmen employed in such things, he said, Sirs, ye know, that our maintenance arises from this occupation. But ye see and hear, that not at Ephesus only, but almost through all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned aside much people, saying, That they are not gods, which are made with hands. So that there is danger, not only that this our craft should be set at nought, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia, and the world worshipeth. And hearing this, they were filled with rage, and cried out, saying, The great Diana of the Ephesians. And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's fellow-travellers. And when Paul would have gone in to the people, the disciples would not suffer him. And some also of the principal officers of Asia, being his friends, sent to him and desired, that he would not venture himself into the theatre. Some therefore cried one thing, and some another; for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know, for what they were come together. And they thrust Alexander forward from among the multitude, the Jews pushing him on; and Alexander, waving with his hand, would have made a defence to the people. But when they knew that he was a Jew, one voice arose from them all, crying out, for about two hours, The great Diana of the Ephesians. But the register, having pacified the people, said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not, that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? Seeing then these things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. For ye have brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess. If then Demetrius and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are held, and there are proconsuls; let them implead one another. But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. And indeed we are in danger to be questioned for sedition, concerning this day; there being no cause, whereby we can account for this concourse. And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly. And after the tumult was ceased, Paul calling the disciples to him, and having taken his leave of them, departed to go into Macedonia. And having gone through those parts, and exhorted them with much discourse, he came into Greece. And having abode there three months, an ambush being laid for him by the Jews, as he was about to sail into Syria, he determined to return by Macedonia. And there accompanied him to Asia Sopater of Berea, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Caius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. These going before, staid for us at Troas, And we set sail from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we abode seven days. And on the first day of the week, when we were met together to break bread, Paul being to depart on the morrow, preached to them, and continued his discourse till midnight. And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled. And a certain young man, named Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a deep sleep: and as Paul still continued his discourse, being overpowered with sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead. And Paul went down and fell on him; and taking him in his arms, said, Be not troubled; for his life is in him. And going up again, and having broken bread, he conversed long with them, even till break of day, and so departed. And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted. But we going before into the ship, sailed to Assos, where we were to take up Paul; for so he had appointed, being himself to go on foot. And when he met us at Assos, we took him up and came to Mitylene. And sailing thence, we came the following day over-against Chios, and the next day we touched at Samos, and having tarried at Trogyllium, the day after came to Miletus. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he hasted, if it were possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. And sending to Ephesus from Miletus, he called thither the elders of the church. And when they were come to him, he said to them, Ye know in what manner I have conversed among you, all the time from the first day I came into Asia, Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me through the ambushes of the Jews: And that I have with-held nothing which was profitable, but have preached to you, and taught you, publickly and from house to house: Testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. And now behold, being bound by the Spirit, I go to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: Save that the Holy Ghost testifieth to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me. But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life precious to myself, so I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. And now I know that ye all among whom I have conversed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men: For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. Take heed therefore to yourselves and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Yea, from among yourselves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, I ceased not to warn every one, night and day, with tears. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are sanctified. I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministred to my necessities, and to them that were with me. I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring ye ought to help the infirm, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, which he himself said, It is happier to give than to receive. And having said these things, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. And they all wept sore, and falling on Paul's neck kissed him, Sorrowing most for that word which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship. And when we were torn away from them, and had set sail, we ran with a strait course to Coos, and the next day to Rhodes, and thence to Patara. And finding a ship passing over to Phenicia, we went aboard and set sail. And coming within sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on the left-hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her burden. And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days, who told Paul by the Spirit, Not to go up to Jerusalem. But when we had finished these days, we departed and went our way; and they all attended us out of the city, with their wives and children: and kneeling down on the sea-shore we prayed. And having embraced each other we took ship, and they returned home. And finishing our voyage, we came from Tyre to Ptolemais, and saluting the brethren, we abode with them one day. And the next day, we departed and came to Cesarea; and entring into the house of Philip the Evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him. And he had four daughters, virgins, who were prophetesses. And as we tarried many days, a certain prophet, named Agabus, came down from Judea. And coming to us, he took up Paul's girdle, and binding his own feet and hands, said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. And when we heard these things, both we, and they of the place, besought him, not to go up to Jerusalem. But Paul answered, What mean ye, weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus. And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. And after these days, we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem. And some of the disciples also from Cesarea went with us, and brought us to one Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. And when we were come up to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. And the next day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. And having saluted them, he gave them a particular account of those things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry. And having heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of believing Jews there are, and they are all zealous for the law. But they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to apostatize from Moses, telling them, not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the customs. What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together; for they will hear that thou art come. Therefore do this that we say to thee: there are with us four men, who have a vow on them: Take them and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know, that there is nothing of those things which they have heard of thee; but that thou thyself walkest orderly, keeping the law. As touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written and determined, that they should observe no such thing; save only that they keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification, till the offering should be offered for every one of them. And when the seven days were about to be accomplished, the Jews that were from Asia seeing him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, Crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: yea, and hath even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place. For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple. And the whole city was moved, and the people ran together; and laying hold on Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were shut. And as they went about to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar: Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they ceased from beating Paul. Then the tribune came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired, Who he was, and what he had done? But some among the multitude cried out one thing, some another; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. But when he came upon the stairs, he was borne of the soldiers, through the violence of the people. For the multitude of people followed after, crying, Away with him. And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out four thousand murtherers into the wilderness? But Paul said, I am a man who am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people. And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, waved his hand to the people: and a great silence being made, he spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye now my defence unto you.(And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence: and he saith) I am verily a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and accurately instructed in the law of our fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women: As likewise the high priest is my witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them who were there to Jerusalem to be punished. But as I journeyed and drew near to Damascus, about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. And they that were with me, saw the light, and were terrified; but they did not hear the voice of him that spake to me, And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed thee to do. And as I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand by them that were with me, I came into Damascus. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there, Coming to me, stood and said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, to know his will, and see that Just one, and hear the voice of his mouth. For thou shalt be his witness to all men, of what thou hast seen and heard. And now, why tarriest thou? Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. And when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance, And saw him saying to me, Make haste and depart quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and kept the garments of them that slew him. But he said to me, Depart: for I will send thee far off to the Gentiles. And they heard him to this word, and then lifted up their voice and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live. And as they cried out, and rent their garments, and cast dust into the air, The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and ordered him to be examined by scourging, that he might know, for what cause they cried so against him. And as they were binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a Roman, even uncondemned? The centurion hearing it, went and told the tribune, saying, Consider what thou art about to do; for this man is a Roman. Then the tribune came and said to him, Tell me, Art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. And the tribune answered, I purchased this freedom with a great sum of money. And Paul said, But I was free-born. Then they who were going to examine him, immediately departed from him: and the tribune was afraid, after he knew he was a Roman, because he had bound him. And on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty, what he was accused of by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come, and bringing Paul down, set him before them. And Paul earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God till this day. And Ananias the high priest commanded them that stood by, to smite him on the mouth. Then said Paul to him, God is about to smite thee, thou whited wall. For sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? But they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? Then said Paul, I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not revile the ruler of thy people. But Paul perceiving, that the one part were Saducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I called in question. And when he had said this, there arose a contention between the Pharisees and the Saducees: and the multitude was divided. For the Saducees say, there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both. And there was a great clamour: and the scribes of the Pharisees side arising, contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God. And as a great disturbance arose, the tribune fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle. And the night following, the Lord standing by him, said, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must testify at Rome also. And when it was day, some of the Jews entering into a conspiracy, bound themselves under a curse, saying, That they would neither eat nor drink, till they had killed Paul. And they were more than forty, who had made this confederacy. And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves by a solemn curse, not to taste anything, till we have killed Paul. Now therefore ye with the council signify to the tribune, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as though ye would more accurately examine the things concerning him: and we, before he came near, are ready to kill him. But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came, and entering into the castle, told Paul. And Paul calling to him one of the centurions, said, Conduct this young man to the tribune; for he hath something to tell him. So he took and led him to the tribune, and said, Paul the prisoner, calling me to him, desired me, to bring this young man to thee, who hath something to tell thee. And the tribune taking him by the hand, and going aside privately asked, What is it, that thou hast to tell me? And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee, to bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would enquire something concerning him more accurately. But do not yield to them; for there are more than forty of them lie in wait, who have bound themselves with a curse, neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, expecting a promise from thee. So the tribune dismissed the young man, having charged him, Tell no man, that thou hast discovered these things to me. And having called to him two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night. And provide beasts, to set Paul upon, and conduct him safe to Felix the governor. And he wrote a letter after this manner, Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Governor Felix, greeting. As this man was seized by the Jews, and about to be killed by them, I came with the soldiery and rescued him, having learned, that he was a Roman. And desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before their council: Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law, but to be charged with nothing worthy of death or of bonds. And when it was shewn me, that an ambush was about to be laid for the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to thee, commanding his accusers also, to say before thee what they have against him. Farewel. The soldiers therefore, taking Paul, as it was commanded them, brought him by night to Antipatris. On the morrow they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him: Who entering into Cesarea, and delivering the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him. And having read it, he asked, of what province he was? And being informed, that he was of Cilicia, I will give thee, said he, a thorough hearing, when thy accusers also are come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace. And after five days, Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and a certain orator, named Tertullus; and appeared before the governor against Paul. And he being called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by thy prudence always, and in all places, We accept it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. But that I may not trouble thee farther, I beseech thee of thy clemency to hear us a few words. For we have found this man, a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: Who hath also attempted to profane the temple; whom we seized and would have judged according to our law. But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands, Commanding his accusers to come to thee, whereby thou mayst thyself on examination, take knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him. And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. Then Paul, after the governor had made a sign to him to speak, answered, Knowing thou hast been for several years a judge to this nation, I the more chearfully answer for myself: As thou mayst know, that it is but twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem. And they neither found me disputing with any man in the temple, nor making an insurrection among the people, either in the synagogues or in the city. Nor can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. But this I confess unto thee, that after the way, which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: Having hope in God, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust, which they themselves also expect. And for this cause do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward man. Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings. Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purifying in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult: Who ought to have been present before thee, and to accuse me, if they had any thing against me. Or let these themselves say, what crime they found in me, when I stood before the council, Unless it be concerning this one word, that I cried, standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead, I am called in question by you this day. And when Felix heard these things, he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias the tribune cometh down, I will take full cognisance of your affair. And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and let him have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting or coming to him. And after some days, Felix coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. And as he reasoned concerning justice, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix being terrified, answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. And he hoped also that money would have been given him by Paul to release him; therefore he sent for him the oftner, and discoursed with him. But after two years, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus: and Felix desiring to gratify the Jews, left Paul bound. Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he went up from Cesarea to Jerusalem. Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews, appeared before him against Paul and besought him, Begging favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying an ambush to kill him by the way. But Festus answered, That Paul should be kept at Cesarea, and that he himself would depart thither shortly. Therefore let those of you, said he, who are able, go down with me and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him. And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Cesarea; and the next day, sitting on the judgment-seat, he commanded Paul to be brought. And when he was come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem, stood round about him, bringing many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove: While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar have I offended at all. But Festus, willing to gratify the Jews, answered Paul and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things? Then said Paul, I am standing at Cesar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou also very well knowest. For if indeed I have done wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there is nothing of the things whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Cesar. Then Festus, having conferred with the council answered, Hast thou appealed to Cesar? To Cesar shalt thou go. And after certain days, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea, to salute Festus. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared the case of Paul to the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix, About whom when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, desiring judgment against him. To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans, to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have liberty to make his defence, touching the crime laid to his charge. When therefore they were come hither, I without any delay sat at the judgment seat the next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth. Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed, But had certain questions against him, relating to their own religious worship, and about one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. And as I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked, If he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these matters? But Paul appealing to be kept for the hearing of Augustus, I command him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar. Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow thou shalt hear him. And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pomp, and were entered into the place of audience, with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all ye who are present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live any longer. But when I found, that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and he had himself appealed to the Emperor, I determined to send him: Of whom I have nothing certain to send to my lord: wherefore I have brought him before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination taken, I may have somewhat to write. For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not to signify also the crimes alledged against him. Then Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. And Paul, stretching forth his hand, made his defence. I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am this day to make my defence before thee, concerning all those things whereof I am accused by the Jews, Who art accurately acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews, wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. The manner of my life from my youth which was from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know, Who knew me from the first, (if they would testify) that I lived a Pharisee, after the strictest sect of our religion. And now I stand in judgment, for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers: To which our twelve tribes, worshiping continually night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews. What? Is it judged by you an incredible thing, that God should raise the dead? I indeed thought myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth: Which also I did in Jerusalem: and having received authority from the chief priests, I shut up many of the saints in prisons, and when they were killed, I gave my vote against them. And frequently punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities. Whereupon as I was going to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief priests, At mid-day, O king, I saw in the way, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round me and them that journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to ordain thee a minister and a witness, both of the things which thou hast seen, and of those in which I will appear to thee, Delivering thee from the people, and the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee, To open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive through faith which is in me, forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified. From that time, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, But first to them at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea, and then to the Gentiles I declare, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance. For these things the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to kill me with their own hands. But having obtained help from God, I continue till this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moses have declared should be, That the Christ having suffered, and being the first who rose from the dead, should shew light to the people and to the Gentiles. And as he was thus making his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad. But he said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter the words of truth and sobriety. For the king knoweth of these things; to whom also I speak with freedom; for I am persuaded none of these things are hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner. King Agrippa, Believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but likewise all that hear me, were this day both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. And as he said this, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them. And as they were going away, they spake one to another, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of death, or of bonds. And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cesar. And as soon as it was determined, that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul, and certain other prisoners, to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan Cohort. And going aboard a ship of Adramyttium, that was to sail by the coasts of Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. And the next day we reached Sidon. And Julius treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends, to refresh himself. And setting sail from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. And having sailed through the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. And the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria there, bound for Italy, put us on board of it. And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were scarce come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone. And passing it with difficulty, we came to the Fair Havens, near which was the city Lasea. And as much time was spent, and sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was already past, Paul exhorted them, Saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage is like to be with injury and much damage, not only to the lading and the ship, but also to our lives. But the centurion regarded the master and the owner of the vessel, more than the things, which were spoken by Paul. And as the haven was not convenient to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence also, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter there, which is an haven of Crete looking to the south-west and north-west. And as the south wind blew gently, supposing they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed on close by Crete. But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Euroclydon. And the ship being caught, and not able to bear up against the wind, we let her drive. And running under a certain Island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get masters of the boat: Which having taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they struck sail, and so were driven. And as we were in an exceeding great storm, the next day they lightened the ship. And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. And as neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was then taken away. But after long abstinence, Paul standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and so have avoided this injury and loss. Yet now I exhort you to be of good courage; for there shall be no loss of any life among you, but of the ship only. For there stood by me this night an angel of the God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be presented before Cesar: and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. Wherefore, Sirs, take courage: for I trust in God, that it shall be even as it hath been spoken to me. But we must be cast on a certain island. And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, the sailors suspected, that they drew nigh some land. And sounding, they found twenty fathoms; and having gone a little farther, sounding again, they found fifteen fathoms. And fearing lest they should fall upon some rocky ground, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. But when the sailors were attempting to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going to carry out anchors from the ship-head, Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off. And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth that ye have tarried and continue fasting, having taken nothing. Therefore I exhort you to take food; for this is for your preservation; for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. And having spoken thus, he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all; and having broken it, he began to eat. Then were they all incouraged, and they also took meat. And we were in the ship in all, two hundred and seventy-six souls. And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea. And when it was day, they did not know the land; but they observed a certain creek having a shore, into which they were minded, if possible, to thrust the ship: And having taken up the anchors, they committed it to the sea, at the same time loosing the rudder-bands, and hoisting up the stay-sail to the wind, they made for the shore. But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a ground; and the fore-part sticking fast, remained immovable, but the hinder-part was broken by the force of the waves. And the counsel of the soldiers was, to kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim away and escape. But the centurion, being desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and commanded those that could swim, throwing themselves into the sea, first to get away to land, And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship; and so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land. And being escaped, we then knew, that the island was called Melita. And the barbarians shewed us uncommon kindness; for having kindled a fire, they brought us all to it, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. Now as Paul was gathering a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper coming from the heat, fastened upon his hand. And when the barbarians saw the venomous animal hanging on his hand, they said one to another, Doubtless this man is a murderer, whom though he hath escaped the sea, vengeance hath not suffered to live. But having shaken off the venomous animal into the fire, he felt no harm. However they expected, that he would have swollen, or suddenly fallen down dead: but after having waited a considerable time, seeing no mischief befall him, they changed their minds and said, that he was a god. And near that place was the estate of the chief man of the island, named Publius, who receiving us into his house, entertained us courteously three days. Now the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and bloody flux; to whom Paul went in, and having prayed, laid his hands on him and healed him. And when this was done, the rest also in the island who had disorders, came and were healed, Who likewise honoured us with many honours, and when we departed, put on board such things as were necessary. And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. And arriving at Syracuse, we tarried there three days, Whence coasting round, we came to Rhegium, and the south wind rising after one day, we came the next to Puteoli: Where finding brethren, we were intreated to tarry with them seven days, and so we went toward Rome. And the brethren having heard of us, came out thence to meet us, some as far as Appii Forum, and others to the Three Taverns, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with the soldier that kept him. And after three days, Paul called the chief of the Jews together. And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet have I been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: Who having examined me, were willing to have released me, because there was no cause of death in me. But when the Jews opposed it, I was constrained to appeal to Cesar; not that I had any thing to accuse my nation of. For this cause therefore have I intreated, to see and speak with you; for it is on account of the hope of Israel, that I am bound with this chain. And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning thee, nor hath any of the brethren coming hither, related or spoke any evil of thee. But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for concerning this sect, we know, that it is every where spoken against. And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he expounded the kingdom of God, testifying and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening. And some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed not. And not agreeing with each other, they brake up the assembly, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, Saying, Go to this people and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive. For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and should be converted, and I should heal them. Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear. And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debating with each other. And Paul continued two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came to him, Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things that relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, no man forbidding him.Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God, Which he had promised before, by his prophets in the holy scriptures, Concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, who was of the seed of David, according to the flesh, But declared the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith in all nations for his name, Among whom are ye also, the called of Jesus Christ: To all that are in Rome, who are beloved of God, called and holy, Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ, for you all, that your faith is spoken of through the whole world. For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, how incessantly I make mention of you, Always requesting in my prayers to come unto you, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God. For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that ye may be established, That is, to be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and me. Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come to you, (though I have been hindred hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles. I am a debtor both to the Greeks and the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise. Therefore, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are at Rome. For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, both to the Jew and to the Gentile. For the righteousness of God is revealed therein from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who detain the truth in unrighteousness. For what is to be known of God, is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it to them. For those things of him which are invisible, both his eternal power and Godhead, are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood by the things which are made, so that they are without excuse: Because knowing God, they did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image in the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed creatures and reptiles. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness in the desires of their hearts, to dishonour their bodies among themselves; Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature above the creator, who is blessed for ever! Amen. Therefore God gave them up to vile affections; for even their women changed the natural use to that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the women, burned in their lust toward each other, men with men working filthiness, and receiving in themselves the just recompence of their error. And as they were not careful to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an undiscerning mind, to do things not expedient, Filled with all injustice, maliciousness, covetousness, wickedness: full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity: Whisperers, backbiters: haters of God, violent, proud: boasters, inventers of evil things: disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful. Who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that do them. Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest; for wherein thou judgest the other, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost the same things. For we know that the judgment of God is according to truth, against them who do such things. And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest them that do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up to thyself wrath in the day of wrath, and revelation, and righteous judgment of God? Who will render to every one according to his works: To them that by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life. But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, Even upon every soul of man who worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also the Gentile: But glory, honour, and peace shall be to every one who worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile. For there is no respect of persons with God. For as many as have sinned without the law, shall also perish without the law; and as many as have sinned under the law, shall be judged by the law. For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these not having the law, are a law to themselves; Who shew the work of the law written upon their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or even defending them, In the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus, according to my gospel. Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and gloriest in God, And knowest his will, and discernest the things that differ, being instructed out of the law: And art confident, that thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, An instructer of the ignorant, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and truth in the law. Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that proclaimest, a man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that sayst, a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? Thou that gloriest in the law, dost thou by transgressing the law dishonour God? For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. Circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou keepest the law; but if thou art a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision. Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? Yea, the uncircumcision that is by nature, fulfilling the law, shall judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision transgressest the law. For he is not a Jew, who is one in outward shew, neither is that circumcision which is apparent in the flesh. But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God. What then is the advantage of the Jew, or what the profit of the circumcision? Much every way; chiefly in that they were intrusted with the oracles of God. For what if some believed not? Shall their unbelief disannul the faithfulness of God? God forbid: let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is not God unjust, who taketh vengeance? I speak as a man. God forbid; for then how should God judge the world? But if the truth of God hath abounded to his glory through my lie, why am I still judged as a sinner? And why may we not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm us to say) do evil, that good may come? Whose damnation is just. What then? Are we better than they? In no wise: for we have before proved all, both Jews and Gentiles, to be under sin. As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one. There is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God. They have all turned aside; they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips. Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; Their feet are swift to shed blood; Destruction and misery are in their ways, And they have not known the way of peace: The fear of God is not before their eyes. Now we know that whatsoever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be found guilty before God. Therefore no flesh shall be justified in his sight by the works of the law; for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But the righteousness of God without the law is now manifested, being attested by the law and the prophets, Even the righteousness of God, by the faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all that believe; for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and are fallen short of the glory of God, And are justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth as a propitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness by the remission of past sins, through the forbearance of God: For a demonstration, I say, of his righteousness in this present time, that he might be just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. We conclude then, that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the law. Is God the God of the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles? Surely of the Gentiles also: Seeing it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the same faith. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. What shall we say then? That our father Abraham hath found according to the flesh? If Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory: but he hath not in the sight of God. For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness. Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is imputed to him for righteousness. So David also describeth the happiness of the man, to whom God imputeth righteousness without works: Happy are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; Happy is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Cometh this happiness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness. How was it then imputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all who believe in uncircumcision, that righteousness may be imputed to them also, And the father of the circumcision, to them who not only are of the circumcision, but also walk in the footsteps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision. For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham or to his seed by the law, but by the righteousness of faith. For if they who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise of no effect. Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. Therefore it is of faith, that it might be of grace, that the promise might be firm to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations) before God in whom he believed, as quickning the dead, and calling the things that are not, as though they were: Who against hope believed in hope, that he should be the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, being about an hundred years old, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, And being fully assured, that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. Now it was not written on his account only, that it was imputed to him, But on ours also, to whom it will be imputed, if we believe on him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead. Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have been introduced through faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, And patience experience, and experience hope; And hope shameth us not, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. For when we were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the ungodly. Now one will scarce die for a just man: yet perhaps for the good man one would even dare to die. But God recommendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved through his life. And not only so, but we also glory in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation. Therefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, even so death passed upon all men, in that all had sinned. For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed, where there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. Yet not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if by the offence of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, that of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as the loss by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the sentence was by one offence to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. For if through one man's offence death reigned by one, they who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness, shall much more reign in life, by one, even Jesus Christ. As therefore by one offence the sentence of death came upon all men to condemnation, so also by one righteousness the free gift came upon all men to justification of life. For as by the disobedience of one man, many were constituted sinners, so by the obedience of one, many shall be constituted righteous. But the law came in between, that the offence might abound: yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: That as sin had reigned through death, so grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. What shall we say then? We will continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we who are dead to sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not, that as many of us have been baptized into Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. And we believe, that if we are dead with Christ, we shall also live with him: Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him. For in that he died, he died to sin once for all; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. So reckon ye also yourselves to be dead to sin, and alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body, to obey it in the desires thereof. Neither present your members to sin, as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members to God, as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are whom ye obey? Whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were the servants of sin, ye have now obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine into which ye have been delivered. Being then set free from sin, ye are become the servants of righteousness. I speak as a man, because of the weakness of your flesh. As ye have presented your members servants to uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity, so now present your members servants of righteousness, unto holiness. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then from those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For death is the wages of sin; but eternal life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as it liveth? For the married woman is bound to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her husband. Therefore if she marry another man while her husband liveth, she will be called an adultress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law, so as to be no adultress, though she marry another man. Thus ye also, my brethren, are dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye might be married to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God. For when we were in the flesh, sinful passions, which were by the law, wrought in our members, so as to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are freed from the law, that whereby we were held being dead, so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. What shall we say then? That the law is sin? God forbid. Yea, I should not have known sin, but for the law. I had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of desire: for without the law sin was dead. And I was once alive without the law; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died, And the commandment, which was intended for life, this I found unto death. For sin taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid: But sin: so that it appeared sin, working death in me by that which is good: so that sin might by the commandment become exceeding sinful. We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do I approve not; for what I would, I do not, but what I hate, that I do. If then I do what I would not, I consent to the law, that it is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good, I find not. For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and captivating me to the law of sin, which is in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with my mind serve the law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin. Therefore there is now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath freed me from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God hath done: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, to be a sacrifice for sin, he hath condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. They that are after the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. Now to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace: Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they who are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwell in you. And if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. Now if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, will also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God. For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The same Spirit beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God. For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by him who subjected it, In hope that the creation itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth together and travaileth together until now. And not only they, but even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, how doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for what we see not, we patiently wait for it. Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered. But he who searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit: for he maketh intercession for the saints, according to God. And we know, that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose. For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated, conformable to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren. And whom he predestinated, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified. What shall we say then to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is also at the right-hand of God, who likewise maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?(As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we more than conquer, through him who hath loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. I say the truth in Christ, I lie not; my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost? That I have great sorrow and continual anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my kinsmen after the flesh: Who are Israelites, whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the worship of God, and the promises: Whose are the fathers, and from whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is, over all, God, blessed for ever. Not as if the word of God had fallen to the ground; for all are not Israel, who are of Israel. Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children, but in Isaac shall thy seed be called: That is, not the children of the flesh are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. For this is the word of the promise, At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one man, our father Isaac, The children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works, but of him that called,) It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written, I have loved Jacob, and hated Esau. What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. It is not therefore of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. Moreover the scripture saith to Pharoah, For this very thing have I raised thee up, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may be declared through all the earth. So then he hath mercy on whom he willeth, and whom he willeth, he hardneth. But thou wilt say to me, Why doth he still find fault? For who hath resisted his will? Nay, but who art thou, O man, that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, out of the same mass to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour? What if God, being willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, yet endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction? And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, whom he had before prepared for glory? Even us whom he hath called, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles: As he saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, who were not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the sons of the living God. Isaiah likewise crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant only shall be saved. For the Lord is finishing and cutting short his account in righteousness; for the Lord will make a short account upon the earth. And as Isaiah had said before, Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and had been made like Gomorrah. What shall we say then? That the Gentiles who followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith: But Israel following after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they stumbled at that stumbling stone; As it is written, Behold I lay in Sion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence: and every one that believeth on him shall not be ashamed. Brethren, the desire of my heart, and my prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved. For I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. For Moses describeth the righteousness which is by the law, The man who doth these things shall live by them. But the righteousness which is by faith speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, (that is, to bring Christ down:) Or who shall descend into the deep?(that is, to bring Christ again from the dead) But what saith he? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach: That if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart, that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made to salvation. For the scripture saith, Every one that believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord of all, is rich to all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved. But how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? But how shall they preach, unless they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them who bring the good tidings of peace, who bring the glad tidings of good things! But all have not obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily; their voice is gone into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. But I say, Hath not Israel known? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a nation; by a foolish nation I will anger you. But Isaiah is very bold and saith, I was found by them that sought me not: I was made manifest to them that asked not after me. Whereas with regard to Israel he saith, All the day have I stretched forth my hands to an unbelieving and gainsaying people. I say then, Hath God rejected his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thy altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer of God to him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. And so likewise at the present time, there is a remnant, according to the election of grace. But if by grace, then it is no more of works: else grace is no longer grace. And if it be of works, then it is no more grace; else work is no longer work. What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh, but the election hath obtained, and the rest were blinded. According as it is written, God hath given them a spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this day. And David saith, Let their table become a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence to them. Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. I say then, Have they stumbled so as to fall? God forbid. But by their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. But if their fall be the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness? For I speak to you Gentiles, as I am the apostle of the Gentiles: I magnify my office: If by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and save some of them. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what will the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? For if the first-fruits be holy, so is the lump: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. And if some of the branches were broken off, and thou being a wild olive wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the good olive, Boast not against the branches, but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. Wilt thou say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in? Well; they were broken off for unbelief, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed left he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God! Toward them that fell severity; but toward thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: else shalt thou also be cut off. And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. For if thou wert cut off from the naturally wild olive-tree, and grafted contrary to nature into a good olive-tree; how much more shall these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive-tree? Brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits) that hardness is in part happened to Israel, till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in: And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Sion, and shall turn away iniquity from Jacob. And this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins. With regard to the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as for the election, they are beloved, for the sake of their fathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance. As then ye were once disobedient to God, but have now obtained mercy through their disobedience: So these also have now been disobedient, that through your mercy they may likewise find mercy. For God hath shut up all together in disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all. O the depth of the riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor? Who hath first given to him, and it shall be repaid him again? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to him be glory for ever! Amen. I exhort you therefore, brethren, by the tender mercies of God, to present your bodies unto God, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. And I say, through the grace which is given to me, to every one that is among you, not to think of himself above what he ought to think, but to think soberly, according to the measure of faith which God hath distributed to every one. For as in one body we are many members, and all members have not the same office, So we being many are one body in Christ, and every one members of each other. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given us, whether it be prophesy, let us prophesy according to the analogy of faith: Or ministry, let us wait on our ministring; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation. He that imparteth, let him do it with simplicity; he that presideth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with chearfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good. In brotherly love be full of tender affection toward each other, in honour preferring one another: Not slothful in business, servent in spirit, serving the Lord: Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, continue instant in prayer. Communicate to the necessities of the saints, pursue hospitality, Bless them who persecute you; bless and curse not. Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Agree in the same affection toward each other. Mind not high, but condescend to low things. Be not wise in your own conceit. Render to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved, revenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thy enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good. Let every soul be subject to the supreme powers, for there is no power but from God; the powers that be, are appointed by God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the appointment of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves condemnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Wouldest thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from it; for he is the servant of God to thee for good. But if thou dost that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the servant of God, an avenger for wrath against him that doth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For this cause ye pay tribute also: for they are the ministers of God, attending continually on this very thing. Render therefore to all their due: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour. Owe no man any thing, but to love another; for he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no evil to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. And do this, knowing the season, that it is high time now to awake out of sleep; for salvation is nearer to us now, then when we first believed. The night is far spent; the day is at hand, let us therefore put off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light. Let us walk decently, as in the day; not in banqueting and drunken entertainments, not in uncleannesses and wantonness, not in strife and envy. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the desires thereof. Him that is weak in the faith, receive; but not to doubtful disputations. For one believeth, that he may eat all things; another who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth; for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another's servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be upheld; for God is able to establish him. One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike; let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord; for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself. But if we live, we live unto the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died and lived again, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living. But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God. Let us therefore no longer judge one another; but judge this rather, not to lay a stumbling block, or a scandal before a brother. I know and am assured by the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: but to him that accounteth any thing to be unclean, it is unclean. But if thy brother is grieved by thy meat, thou no longer walkest charitably. Destroy not him by thy meat, for whom Christ died. Therefore let not your good be evil spoken of. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. And he that in these serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved by men. Let us therefore pursue the things that tend to peace, and to mutual edification. For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure: but it is evil to that man who eateth with offence. It is good, not to eat flesh, neither to drink wine, nor to do any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or made weak. Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because it is not of faith; for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin. Therefore we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbour, for his good, to edification. For Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me. For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our instruction, that we, through patience and consolation of the scriptures, may have hope. Now the God of patience and consolation give you to think the same thing, according to Christ Jesus, That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also hath received you, to the glory of God. Now I say, Christ Jesus was a servant of the circumcision, for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers: And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and laud him, all ye people. And again Isaiah faith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and one arising to rule over the Gentiles: in him shall the Gentiles hope. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye likewise are full of goodness, being filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one another. Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly to you, in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace which is given to me of God, That I should be the servant of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministring the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. I have therefore whereof to glory, through Jesus Christ, in the things pertaining to God. For I will not dare to speak of any thing which Christ hath not done by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit, so that I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ, from Jerusalem round about, as far as Illyricum. But I have striven, so to preach the gospel, not where Christ had been named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation. But as it is written, They to whom he was not spoken of shall see; and they that have not heard, shall understand. Therefore I have been long hindered from coming to you. But now having no longer place in these parts, and having had a great desire for many years to come to you, Whenever I go into Spain, I will come to you; for I hope to see you as I pass by, and to be brought forward by you in my way thither, if first I may be somewhat satisfied with your company. But I am now going to Jerusalem, serving the saints. For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a collection for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem. It hath pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have partook of their spiritual things, they ought to minister to them in carnal things. When therefore I have performed this, and sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain. And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me, in your prayers to God for me, That I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service at Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints: That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you. Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen! I commend unto you Phebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea, That ye may receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and assist her in whatsoever business she needeth you: for she hath been an helper of many, and of myself also. Salute Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow-labourers in Christ Jesus: Who for my life, have laid down their own necks; to whom not I alone owe my thanks, but likewise all the churches of the Gentiles. Salute also the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epenetus, who is the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ. Salute Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are in repute among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord. Salute Urbanus, our fellow-labourer in Christ, and my beloved Stachys. Salute Apelles, approved in Christ. Salute those of the family of Aristobulus. Salute my kinsman Herodion. Salute those of the family of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, who hath laboured much in the Lord. Salute Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren who are with them. Salute Philologus and Julias, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them. Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you. Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them who cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them. For such serve not the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches, deceive the hearts of the simple. For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I rejoice therefore on your behalf; but I would have you wise with regard to that which is good, and simple with regard to that which is evil. And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Timothy my fellow-labourer, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen salute you. I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord. Caius, my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus, a brother. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. Now to him who is able to stablish you, according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, (according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret since the world began, But now made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith) To the only wise God, to him be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen!Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes a brother, To the church of God, which is in Corinth, to them that are sanctified through Christ Jesus, called and holy, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours: Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Christ Jesus: That in every thing ye are inriched through him, in all utterance and in all knowledge, As the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you: So that ye are wanting in no good gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who will also confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you, but that ye be perfectly joined together, in the same mind and in the same judgment. For it hath been declared to me of you, my brethren, by them of the family of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. Now this I say, every one of you saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized into the name of Paul? I thank God, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius: Lest any should say, that I had baptized in my own name. I baptized also the family of Stephanas. I know not that I baptized any other. For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel; but not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. For the doctrine of the cross is indeed to them that perish foolishness; but to us who are saved, it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and abolish the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. For whereas the Jews demand signs, and the Greeks seek wisdom, We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness: But to them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. Behold your calling brethren: that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world, to shame the things that are mighty: And the base things of the world, and things that are despised, hath God chosen; yea, things that are not, to bring to nought the things that are; That no flesh may glory before him. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is made by God unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: That as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know any thing among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. And my speech and my preaching was not with the persuasive words of human wisdom, but with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power. That your faith might not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Yet we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: but not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God ordained before the world for our glory; Which none of the rulers of this world knew; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor hath ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man which is in him? So the things of God also knoweth no one, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which are freely given to us of God. Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, explaining spiritual things by spiritual words. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit; for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But the spiritual man discerneth all things, while he himself is discerned by no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ. I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nor are ye now able. For ye are still carnal: for while there is among you emulation, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man? For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. But he that planteth and he that watereth are one; and every one shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour. For we are fellow-labourers of God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master-builder I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon; but let every one take heed how he buildeth thereon. For other foundation can no man lay, than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ: And if any one build on this foundation, gold, silver, costly stones; wood, hay, stubble, Every one's work shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare it: for it is revealed by fire; yea the fire shall try every one's work, of what sort it is. If any one's work which he hath built thereon shall remain, he shall receive a reward. If any one's work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but himself shall be saved, yet so as through the fire. Know ye not, that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man destroy the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. Let none deceive himself: if any one among you thinketh himself to be wise, let him become a fool in this world, that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; as it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. Therefore let none glory in men; for all things are yours: Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas; or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours, And ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's. Let a man so account us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. But it is a very small thing with me, to be judged by you or by any man's judgment; yea, I judge not myself. For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall every one have praise from God. These things, brethren, I have by a figure transferred to myself and Apollos, for your sakes; that ye may learn in us, not to think of men above what is here written, that ye may not be puffed up for one above another. For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou boast, as if thou hadst not received it? Now ye are full: now ye are rich: ye have reigned as kings without us. And I would ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. For I think God hath set forth us the apostles last, as appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake; but ye are wise in Christ: we are weak; but ye are strong: ye are honourable; but we are despised. Even to this present hour, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain abode, And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and off-scouring of all things to this day. I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you. For if ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for I have begotten you in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I beseech you therefore, be ye followers of me. For this cause I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. Now some are puffed up, as if I would not come to you. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord permit, and will know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power. For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power. What will ye? That I come to you with a rod? or in love, and the spirit of meekness? It is commonly reported, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication, as is not even named among the heathens, that one should have his father's wife. And are ye puffed up? Have ye not rather mourned, that he who hath done this deed, might be taken from among you? For I verily as absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as if I were present, judged him who hath so done this, In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, To deliver such an one to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Your glorying is not good: know ye not, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened; for our passover is slain for us, even Christ: Therefore let us keep the feast; not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of wickedness and malignity, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. I wrote to you in an epistle, Not to converse with lewd persons. But not altogether with the lewd persons of this world, or the covetous, or the rapacious, or idolaters, for then ye must go out of the world. But I have now written unto you, if any who is named a brother, be a lewd person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or rapacious, not to converse with such an one, no, not to eat with him. For what have I to do, to judge them also that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?(But them that are without God will judge:) And ye will take away from among yourselves that wicked person. Dare any of you, having a matter against another, refer it to the unjust, and not to the saints? Know ye not, that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not, that we shall judge angels? How much more things pertaining to this life? If then ye have any controversies of things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no esteem in the church? I speak to your shame. What, is there not so much as one wise man among you, that shall be able to judge between his brethren? But brother goeth to law with brother, and this before the infidels. Indeed even this is altogether a fault among you, that ye have contests with each other. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, even your brethren. Know ye not, that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor sodomites, Nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor revilers, nor the rapacious shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. All things are lawful for me; but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any. Meats are for the belly, and the belly for meats; yet God will destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power. Know ye not, that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. Know ye not, that he who is joined to an harlot is one body? For they two, saith he, shall be one flesh. But he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit. Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body. Know ye not, that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have from God? And ye are not your own: For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God with your body and your spirit, which are God's. Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote to me, It is good for a man, not to touch a woman. Yet, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife; and let every woman have her own husband. Let the husband render the debt to the wife; and in like manner the wife also to the husband. The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband; and in like manner the husband also hath not power over his own body, but the wife. Withdraw not from each other, unless it be by consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to prayer, and may come together again, lest Satan tempt you through your incontinence. But I say this by way of advice, not by way of precept. For I would that all men were even as myself: but every one hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, another after that. But to the unmarried and the widows I say, It is good for them, if they remain even as I. But if they have not power over themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn. The married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband. But if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife. To the rest speak I, not the Lord. If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the wife, who hath an unbelieving husband, that consenteth to live with her, let her not put him away. For the unbelieving husband hath been sanctified by the wife; and the unbelieving wife hath been sanctified by the husband. Else were your children unclean; but now they are holy. But if the unbeliever will depart, let him depart: a brother or a sister is not inslaved in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. For how knowest thou, O wife, but thou mayst save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, but thou mayst save thy wife? But as God hath distributed to every one, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And thus I ordain in all the churches. Is any one called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any one called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God. Let every one in the calling wherein he is called, therein abide. Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou canst be made free, use it rather. For he that is called by the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman; and in like manner, he that is called being free, is the servant of Christ. Ye are bought with a price; do not become the servants of men. Brethren, let every one wherein he is called, therein abide with God. Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one who hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I apprehend therefore, that this is good for the present distress, that it is good for a man to continue as he is. Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed: art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. Yet if thou dost marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh; but I spare you. But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that even they that have wives, be as if they had none: And they that weep, as if they wept not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as if they possessed not; And they that use this world, as not abusing it; for the fashion of this world passeth away: Now I would have you without carefulness. The unmarried man careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. But the married careth for the things of the world , how he may please his wife. There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit: but the married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. And this I say for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but that ye may decently wait upon the Lord without distraction. But if any think that he acteth indecently toward his virgin, if she be above age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power over his own will, and hath determined this in his heart to keep his virgin, doth well. So then he also that giveth in marriage, doth well; but he that giveth not in marriage, doth better. The wife is bound as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to marry whom she will; only in the Lord. But she is happier, if she continue as she is, in my judgment; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God. Now as to things sacrified to idols, we know: for all of us have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. And if any one think he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. But if any one love God, he is known by him. I say, as to the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are many gods and many lords) Yet to us there is but one God, the Father from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. But there is not in all men this knowledge; for some do even until now, with consciousness of the idol, eat it as sacrificed to the idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. But meat commendeth us not to God; for neither if we eat, are we the better, nor if we eat not, are we the worse. But take heed, lest by any means this your liberty become a stumbling-block to the weak. For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, sitting at meat in an idol-temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak be encouraged to eat of the things sacrificed to the idol? And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died. But when ye sin thus against your brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend. Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord? If I am not an apostle to others, yet I am to you; for ye are the seal of my apostleship. My answer to them who examine me is this. Have we not power to eat and to drink? Have we not power to lead about with us a sister, a wife, as well as the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Peter? Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working? Who ever warreth at his own charge? Who planteth a vineyard, and doth not eat of its fruit? Or who feedeth a flock, and doth not eat of the milk of the flock? Do I speak these things as a man? Doth not the law also speak the same? For it is written, in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn? Doth God take care for oxen? Or speaketh he chiefly for our sakes? surely for our sakes it was written: for he who ploweth, ought to plow in hope; and he that thresheth in hope, ought to be a partaker of his hope. If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter, if we shall reap your carnal things? If others partake of this power over you, do not we rather? Yet we have not used this power: but we suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. Know ye not, that they who are employed about holy things, are fed out of the temple? And they who wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar. So also hath the Lord ordained, that they who preach the gospel, should live of the gospel. But I have used none of these things; nor have I written thus, that it might be done so unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make this my glorying void. For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for a necessity lieth upon me, and wo is me, if I preach not the gospel. If indeed I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, yet a dispensation is intrusted to me. What then is my reward? that when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. For though I am free from all men, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more. To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law: To them that are without the law, as without the law, (being not without the law to God, but under the law to Christ) that I might gain them that are without the law. To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that by all means I might save some. And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I may be partaker thereof with you. Know ye not, that they who run in the race, all run, but one receiveth the prize? so run that ye may obtain. And every one that contendeth, is temperate in all things: and they indeed, to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; I so fight, not as one that beateth the air. But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest by any means, after having preached to others, I myself should become a reprobate. Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, And were all baptized unto Moses, in the cloud and in the sea, And all ate the same spiritual meat, And all drank the same spiritual drink (for they drank out of the spiritual rock which followed them; and that rock was Christ) Yet, with the most of them, God was not well-pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were for our example, that we might not desire evil things, as they desired. Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer. Now all these things happened to them for examples, and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages are come. Therefore let him that standeth, take heed, lest he fall. There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above your ability, but will with the temptation make also a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we, being many, are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of the one bread. Consider Israel after the flesh. Are not they who eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar? What say I then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is any thing? or that an idol is any thing? But that what the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. Now I would not that ye should be partakers with devils. Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and the table of devils. Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me; but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me; but all things edify not. Let no one seek his own, but every one another's welfare. Whatever is sold in the shambles eat, asking no questions for conscience sake. For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. And if any of the unbelievers invite you, and ye are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for conscience sake. But if any one say to you, This hath been sacrificed to an idol, eat not, for his sake that shewed thee, and for conscience sake. Conscience I say, not thy own, but that of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another's conscience? For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I blamed for that for which I give thanks? Therefore whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. Give no offence either to the Jews, or to the Gentiles, or to the church of God: Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but that of many that they may be saved. Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ. Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the orders, as I delivered them to you. But I would have you know, that the head of the woman is the man, and the head of every man is Christ, and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, dishonoureth his head. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered, dishonoureth her head; for it is the same as if she were shaved. Therefore if a woman is not covered, let her also be shaved: but if it be shameful, for a woman to have her hair shaved off, or cut short, let her be covered. A man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man. For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the sake of the woman, but the woman for the sake of the man. For this cause also the woman ought to have a veil upon her head, because of the angels. Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord. And as the woman was of the man, so also the man is by the woman; but all things are of God. Judge of yourselves: is it decent for a woman to pray to God uncovered? Doth not nature itself teach you, that for a man to have long hair, is a disgrace to him? Whereas for a woman to have long hair, is a glory to her; for her hair was given her instead of a veil. But if any one be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. But in this which I declare, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. For first, when ye come together in the church, I hear there are schisms among you, (and I partly believe it. For there must be heresies also among you, that the approved among you may be manifest). Therefore when ye come together into one place, it is not eating the Lord's supper. For in eating every one taketh before another his own supper, and one is hungry, another drinks largely. What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or do ye despise the church of God, and shame them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me. In like manner also he took the cup after he had supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. Therefore as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye shew forth the Lord's death, till he come. So that whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. Therefore let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not distinguishing the Lord's body. For this cause many are sick and weak among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another. And if any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye come not together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. Ye know that when ye were heathens, ye were carried away after dumb idols, as ye were led. Therefore I give you to know, that as no one speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed; so no one can say, Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are diversities of administrations, but the same Lord: And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each, to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another by the same Spirit, the word of knowledge; To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gift of healing by the same Spirit; To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit worketh all these, dividing to every one severally as he willeth. For as the body is one, and yet hath many members, but all the members of the body, many as they are, are one body, so is Christ. For we are all baptized by one Spirit into one body, whether we are Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or freemen; and we have all drank of one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot should say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear should say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? But now hath God set the members, every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. And if all were one member, where were the body? Whereas now there are indeed many members, yet but one body. And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Yea, the members of the body, which appear to be weaker, are much more necessary. And those which we think to be the less honourable parts of the body, these we surround with more abundant honour, and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. For our comely parts have no need; but God hath tempered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that which lacked: That there might be no schism in the body, but that the members might have the same care for each other: And whether one member suffer, all the members might suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members might rejoice with it. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in part. And God hath set in the church, first, apostles, secondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers: afterward miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, different kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? have all miraculous powers? Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But covet earnestly the best gifts. And yet I shew unto you a more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing. And though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and deliver up my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing. Love suffereth long and is kind; love envieth not; love acteth not rashly, is not puffed up: Doth not behave indecently, seeketh not her own, is not provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not at iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth: Covereth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. And when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall vanish away. When I was a child, I talked as a child, I understood as a child, I reasoned as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. And now we see by means of a glass obscurely; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known. And now abide these three, faith, hope, love; but the greatest of these is love. Follow after love: and desire spiritual gifts; but especially that ye may prophesy. For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not to men, but to God; for no one understandeth him, though by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries: Whereas he that prophesieth, speaketh to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. He that speaketh in an unknown tongue, edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church. I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied; for he that prophesieth, is greater than he that speaketh with tongues, unless he interpret, that the church may receive edification. Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you, either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by doctrine? So inanimate things which give a sound, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? And if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle? So likewise unless ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For ye will speak to the air. Let there be ever so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them without signification: Yet if I know not the meaning of the language, I shall be a barbarian to him that speaketh, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian to me. So ye also, seeing ye desire spiritual gifts, seek to abound in them, to the edifying of the church. Therefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret. For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. What then is my duty? I will pray with the Spirit; but I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the Spirit; but I will sing with the understanding also. Otherwise if thou givest thanks with the Spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of a private person, say Amen to thy thanksgiving, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? For thou verily givest thanks well; yet the other is not edified. I thank God, that I speak with tongues more than you all. Yet in the congregation I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. Brethren, be not children in understanding: in wickedness be ye as infants, but in understanding be ye grown men. It is written in the law, In foreign tongues and with foreign lips will I speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord. So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; whereas prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers. Yet if the whole church be met together, and all speak with unknown tongues, and there come in ignorant persons or unbelievers, will they not say, that ye are mad? Whereas if all prophesy, and there come in an unbeliever, or an ignorant person, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all: The secrets of his heart are made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and declare that God is among you of a truth. What a thing is it, brethren, that when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation? Let all things be done to edification. If any one speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two or three at most, and that by course, and let one interpret. But if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God. Let two or three of the prophets speak, and let the rest judge. But if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first be silent. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. For the Spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints. Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the law also saith. And if they desire to learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is indecent for a woman to speak in the assembly. Did the word of God come out from you? or did it come to you alone? If any one think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you, are the commandments of the Lord. But if any one is ignorant, let him be ignorant. Therefore, brethren, covet to prophesy; yet forbid not to speak with tongues. Let all things be done decently and in order. Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also ye received, and wherein ye stand: By which also ye are saved, if ye retain what I preached to you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered to you first, that which I also received, That Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures, And that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. Afterwards he was seen by above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep. After this he was seen by James, then by all the apostles. Last of all he was seen by me also, as an untimely birth. For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Whether therefore I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. But if Christ is preached, that he rose from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead? For if there be no resurrection of the dead, neither is Christ raised. And if Christ be not raised, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified from God, that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise, if the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, neither is Christ raised: And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are still in your sins. Then also they who sleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are more miserable than all men. But now is Christ risen from the dead, the first-fruit of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as through Adam all die, even so through Christ shall all be made alive. But every one in his own order: Christ the first-fruit, afterward they who are Christ's, at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that is destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put under him, it is manifest that he who did put all things under him is excepted. But when all things shall be put under him, then shall the Son himself also be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. Else what shall they do, who are baptized for the dead? If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for them? Why are we also in danger every hour? I protest by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. If after the manner of men, I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die. Be not deceived. Evil communications corrupt good manners. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. But some one will say, How are the dead raised? And with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die, And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat, or of any other corn: But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to each of the seeds, its own body. All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one kind of flesh of men, another of beasts, another of fishes, another of birds. There are also heavenly, and there are earthly bodies: but the glory of the heavenly is one, and that of the earthly another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: and one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. It is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam is a quickening Spirit. Yet the spiritual body was not first, but the animal; afterward the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As was the earthy, such are they also that are earthy, and as was the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory; The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord. Concerning the collection for the saints, as I have ordered the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. On the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store according as he hath been prospered, that there may be no collections when I come. And when I am come, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters, to carry your gift to Jerusalem. And if it be proper, that I also should go, they shall go with me. Now I will come to you, when I have passed through Macedonia,(for I pass through Macedonia) And perhaps I may stay, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me forward on my journey, whithersoever I go. For I will not see you now in my way; but hope to stay some time with you, if the Lord permit. But I will stay at Ephesus till Pentecost. For a great and effectual door is opened to me, and there are many adversaries. But if Timotheus come, see that he be with you without fear; for he laboureth in the work of the Lord, even as I. Therefore let no man despise him, but conduct him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I look for him with the brethren. As to our brother Apollos, I besought him much, to come to you with the brethren; yet he was by no means willing to come now; but he will come, when it shall be convenient. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, acquit yourselves like men; be strong. Let all your affairs be done in love. And I beseech you, brethren, as ye know the houshold of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to serve the saints, That ye also submit to such, and to every one that worketh with us and laboureth. I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus: for they have supplied what was wanting on your part. For they have refreshed my spirit and yours; such therefore acknowledge. The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church that is in their house, salute you much in the Lord. All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with an holy kiss. The Salutation of me Paul with my own hand. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema: Maran-atha. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus.Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia: Grace and peace be to you from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, Who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ. And whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effectual in the patient enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. And our hope concerning you is stedfast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the comfort. For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of the trouble which befell us in Asia, that we were exceedingly pressed, above our strength, so that we despaired even of life. Yea, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raiseth the dead: Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust, that he will still deliver: You likewise helping together with us by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf. For this is our rejoicing, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more especially toward you. For we write no other things to you, but what ye know and acknowledge, and I trust will acknowledge even to the end. As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, as ye also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus. And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that ye might have had a second benefit, And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be brought forward by you in my way toward Judea. Now when I was thus minded, did I use levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that there should be with me yea and nay? As God is faithful, our word to you hath not been yea and nay. For Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, by me, and Silvanus, and Timotheus was not yea and nay; but was yea in him. For all the promises of God are yea in him, and amen in him, to the glory of God by us. For he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us is God: Who hath also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. But I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you, I came not as yet to Corinth. Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye have stood. But I determined this with myself not to come to you again in grief. For if I grieve you, who is he that cheareth me, but he that is grieved by me? And I wrote thus to you, that I might not when I come have grief from those for whom I ought to rejoice; being persuaded concerning you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. For from much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that ye might be grieved, but that ye might know the abundant love which I have toward you. And if any have caused grief, he hath grieved me but in part, that I may not overburden you all. Sufficient for such an one is this punishment inflicted by many. So that on the contrary ye should rather forgive and comfort him, lest such an one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. I beseech you therefore to confirm your love toward him. For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye were obedient in all things. To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: and if I forgive any thing, to whom I forgive it, it is for your sakes, in the person of Christ. Lest Satan get an advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his devices. Now when I came to Troas, to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord, I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; so taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia. Now thanks be to God, who causeth us always to triumph through Christ, and manifesteth by us in every place the odour of his knowledge. For we are to God a sweet odour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: To these an odour of death unto death, but to those an odour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? For we are not as many, who adulterate the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ. Do we again begin to recommend ourselves? Unless we need, as some do, recommendatory letters to you, or recommendatory letters from you? Ye are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by all men: Manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart. Such trust have we in God through Christ. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think any thing as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God: Who also hath made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life. And if the ministration of death engraven in letters on stones was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly on the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face, which was to be abolished: Shall not rather the ministration of the Spirit be glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation was glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excelleth. For if that which is abolished was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious. Having therefore this hope, we use great plainness of speech. And not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly to the end of that which is abolished. But their understandings were blinded: and until this day the same veil remaineth unremoved on the reading of the old testament, which is taken away in Christ. But the veil lieth on their heart when Moses is read until this day. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. And we all with unveiled face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. Therefore having this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not: But have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor deceitfully corrupting the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel also is veiled, it is veiled to them that perish; Whose unbelieving minds the god of this world hath blinded, lest the illumination of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine upon them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to inlighten us with the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; thrown down, but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body. We who live are always delivered unto death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal body. So then death worketh in us, but life in you. Yet having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken, we also believe, and therefore speak: Knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus, will also raise us up by Jesus, and present us with you. For all things are for your sakes, that the overflowing grace might through the thanksgiving of many abound to the glory of God. Therefore we faint not, but even though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory: While we aim not at the things that are seen, but the things that are not seen: for the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon, with our house which is from heaven: If being clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened; not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life. Now he that hath wrought us to this very thing is God, who hath also given us the earnest of the Spirit. Therefore we always behave undauntedly; knowing that while we are sojourning in the body, we are absent from the Lord:(For we walk by faith, not by sight.) We behave undauntedly, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. Therefore we are ambitious, whether present, or absent, to be well-pleasing to him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive according to what he hath done in the body, whether good or evil. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men: but we are made manifest to God, and I trust we are made manifest in your consciences also. We do not again recommend ourselves to you; but we give you an occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have something to answer them, who glory in appearance, and not in heart. For if we are transported beyond ourselves, it is to God; if we are sober, it is for your sakes. For the love of Christ constraineth us, while we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again. So that we from this time know no one after the flesh; yea, if we have known even Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more. Therefore if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation: the old things are passed way; behold, all things are become new: And all things are from God, who hath reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation: Namely, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their traspasses to them, and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation. Therefore we are embassadors for Christ, as though God were intreating by us: we beseech you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God through him. We then, as fellow-labourers, do also exhort you, not to receive the grace of God in vain.(For he saith, I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in a day of salvation have I succoured thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed, But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; By purity, by prudence, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right-hand and the left: Through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, yet true, As unknown, yet well-known; as dying, yet behold we live; as chastened, yet not killed; As sorrowing, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is opened toward you, our heart is inlarged. Ye are not straitened in us; but ye are straitened in your own bowels. Now for a recompence of the same, (I speak as to my children) be ye also inlarged. Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? or what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath a believer with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? Now ye are the temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. Therefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean person, saith the Lord, and I will receive you, And will be to you a Father, and ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. Having therefore, beloved, these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Receive us. We have hurt no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. I speak not, to condemn you; for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts, to live and to die with you. Great is my freedom of speech toward you; great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I exceedingly abound with joy, over all our affliction. For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side: from without were fightings, from within were fears. But God who comforteth them that are brought low, comforted us by the coming of Titus. And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted over you, when he told us your earnest desire, your grief, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more. For I do not repent that I grieved you by the letter, though I did repent: (for I see that letter grieved you, though but for a season.) Now I rejoice, not that ye grieved, but that ye grieved to repentance; for ye grieved in a godly manner, so that ye received damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation not to be repented of, whereas the sorrow of the world worketh death. For behold, this very thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly manner, what diligence it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge? In all things ye have approved yourselves to be pure in this matter. And though I wrote to you, it was not for his sake who had done the wrong, nor for his sake who had suffered it, but for the sake of manifesting to you in the sight of God our diligent care over you. Therefore we were comforted in your comfort, and we rejoiced the more exceedingly in the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. So that if I had boasted any thing of you to him, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so also our boasting to Titus is found a truth. And his tender affection is more abundant toward you, calling to mind the obedience of you all, how ye received him with fear and trembling. I rejoice therefore, that I have confidence in you in all things. Moreover, brethren, we declare to you the grace of God, bestowed on the churches in Macedonia, That in a great trial of affliction, their overflowing joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality: That to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, they were willing of themselves, Praying us with much intreaty, to receive the gift and take a part in ministring it to the saints. And this they did, not as we hoped; but first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God: So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also compleat this gift among you. Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. I speak not by way of command, but that by the diligence of others, I may prove the sincerity of your love. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun a year ago, not only to do, but also to do it willingly. Now therefore compleat the work, that as there was a ready will, so there may be also a performance, in proportion to what ye have. For if there be first a ready mind, a man is accepted, according to what he hath, not according to what he hath not. For I do not mean, that others should be eased, and you burthened; But by an equality, let your abundance be at this time a supply to their want; that their abundance also may be a supply to your want, that there may be an equality, As it is written, He that had gathered the most, had nothing over; and he that had gathered the least, did not lack. But thanks be to God, who put the same diligent care for you in the heart of Titus. For he accepted indeed the exhortation, but being more forward, he went to you of his own accord. And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is through all the churches: (And not only so, but he was also appointed by the churches to be a fellow-traveller with us, with this gift, which is administred by us, to the glory of the Lord himself, and for the declaration of our ready mind) Avoiding this, lest any one should blame us in this abundance, which is administred by us. For we provide things honest, not only before the Lord, but also before men. And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, through his great confidence in you. If any inquire concerning Titus, he is my partner, and fellow-labourer with respect to you; or concerning our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. Shew therefore to them before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf. For concerning the ministring to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you. For I know your readiness, which I boast concerning you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you on this head should be made vain, that, as I said, ye may be ready; Lest if any of the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say, you) be ashamed of this confident boasting. Therefore I thought it necessary, to desire the brethren to go before to you, and compleat this your bounty, which had been spoken of before, that it may be ready as a bounty, and not as a matter of covetousness. And this I say, He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully: Let every man do as he chuseth in his heart, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a chearful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that having always all sufficiency in all things, ye may abound to every good work:(As it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness remaineth for ever. And may he who supplieth seed to the sower, and bread for your food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:) Being inriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which worketh by us thanksgiving to God. For the administration of this service, doth not only supply the necessities of the saints, but likewise aboundeth by the thanksgivings of many to God:(Who, by experiment of this administration, glorify God for your avowed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal communication to them and to all men.) And by their prayer for you, who long after you, for the exceeding grace of God, which is in you. Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift. Now I Paul myself, who when present am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you, intreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I beseech, that I may not when I am present be bold with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold toward some, who think of us as walking after the flesh: For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the throwing down of strong-holds.) Destroying reasonings, and every high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, And being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, now your obedience is fulfilled. Do ye look at the outward appearance of things? If any man be confident, that he is Christ's, let him again think this of himself, that as he is Christ's, so we also are Christ's. Yea, if I should boast something more also of the authority which the Lord hath given us, for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: That I may not seem to terrify you by letters. For his letters indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. Let such an one think this, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, such are we also in deed, when we are present. For we presume not to equal or to compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves: but they among themselves limiting themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise. But we will not boastingly extend ourselves beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the providence, which God hath allotted us, a measure to reach even unto you. For we do not extend ourselves excessively, as not reaching to you; for we are come even to you, in the gospel of Christ: Not boastingly extending ourselves beyond our measure, in the labours of others; but having hope, now your faith is increased, to be inlarged by you, yet still within our province, abundantly, So as to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, not to boast in another's province of things made ready to our hand. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. I wish ye would bear a little with my folly; yea, bear with me. For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy; for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear lest as the serpent deceived Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from simplicity toward Christ. If indeed he that cometh preach another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another Spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. But I suppose that I fall nothing short of the very chief apostles. For if I am unskilful in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly manifest to you in all things. Have I committed an offence in humbling myself, that ye might be exalted, because I have preached the gospel of God to you at free cost? I spoiled other churches, taking wages of them, to serve you: and when I was present with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no man. For the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my want; and I have in all things kept myself from being burdensom, and will keep myself. As the truth of Christ is in me, this my boasting shall not be stopped in the regions of Achaia. Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth. But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off the occasion from them who desire occasion, that wherein they boast, they may be found even as we. For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing, if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose ends shall be according to their works. I say again, Let no man think me a fool; but if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I also may boast a little. What I speak, I speak not after the Lord; but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. Seeing many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. For ye, being wise, suffer fools willingly. For ye suffer, if a man inslave you, if he devour you, if he take from you, if he exalt himself, if he smite you on the face. I speak with regard to reproach, as though we had been weak: whereas in whatever any is confident, (I speak as a fool) I am confident also. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak foolishly) I more: in labours more abundantly, in stripes more exceedingly, in prisons more abundantly, in deaths often. Five times I received from the Jews forty stripes save one. Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I have been shipwrecked, a day and a night I passed in the deep: In journeyings often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from the heathen; in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brethren: In labour and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Beside the things which are from without, that which rusheth upon me daily, the care of all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not? Since I must glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmities. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not. In Damascus the governor under king Aretas, kept the city of the Damascenes with a guard, being determined to apprehend me. But I was let down through a window in a basket by the wall, and escaped from his hands. Surely it is not expedient for me to boast: yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ, above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not; God knoweth) such an one caught up to the third heaven. Yea, I knew such a man (whether in the body or out of the body, I know not, God knoweth) That he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things, which it is not possible for man to utter. Of such an one I will glory; but I will not glory of myself, unless in my infirmities. For if I should resolve to boast, I should not be a fool; for I speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any one should think of me above what he seeth me, or heareth from me. And lest I should be lifted up with the abundance of the revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should be lifted up. Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. But he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the strength of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong. I am become a fool in boasting; but ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing have I fallen short of the very chief apostles, though I am nothing. Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. For wherein were ye inferior to the other churches, unless that I myself was not burdensom to you. Forgive me this wrong. Behold the third time I am ready to come to you: yet I will not be burdensom to you; for I seek not yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children. And I will most gladly spend, and be spent for your souls, though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved. But be it so: I did not burden you: but being crafty, I caught you with guile. Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you? I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? In the same steps? Think ye that we again excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ, and all things, beloved, for your edification. For I fear lest when I come, I should not find you such as I would, and lest I should be found by you such as ye would not: lest there should be contentions, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults, Lest my God should humble me when I come to you again, and I should mourn over many of them who had sinned before, and have not repented of the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed. I am coming to you this third time: every word shall be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses. I told you before, and do tell before-hand (though now absent, as if I were present the second time) those who had sinned before, and all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare: Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but powerful among you. For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God: and we also are weak with him; but we shall live with him, by the power of God in you. Examine yourselves, whether ye are in the faith: prove yourselves. Do ye not know yourselves? That Jesus Christ is in you? unless ye are reprobates. And I trust, ye shall know, that we are not reprobates. Now I pray God, that ye may do no evil: not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is good, though we should be as reprobates. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use severity, according to the power which the Lord hath given me, for edification, and not for destruction. Finally, brethren, farewel: be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you. Salute one another with an holy kiss. All the saints salute you. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.Paul an apostle (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead) And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia, Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave himself for our sins,(that he might deliver us from the present evil world ) according to the will of God and our Father, To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Christ who called you by his grace to another gospel, Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would subvert the gospel of Christ. But if we or an angel from heaven preach to you another gospel than we have preached to you, let him be accursed: As we have said before, so I say now again, if any preach to you another gospel than that ye received, let him be accursed. For do I now satisfy men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For neither did I receive it from man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. For ye have heard of my behaviour in time past in the Jewish religion, that above measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it. And I profited in the Jewish religion above many of my years among my countrymen, being more abundantly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood: Neither did I go up to Jerusalem, to them that were apostles before me, but I immediately went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. But other of the apostles I saw none, save James, the brother of the Lord. Now the things which I write to you, behold before God, I lie not. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ. Only they had heard, He that persecuted in time past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. And they glorified God in me. Then fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. I went up by revelation, and explained to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles; but severally to those of eminence, lest by any means I should run, or should have run in vain.(But neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised, Because of false brethren introduced unawares, who came in privily, to spy out our liberty which we have through Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: To whom we did not yield by submission, no, not an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.) And they who undoubtedly were something, (but whatsoever they were, it is no difference to me; God accepteth no man's person) they who undoubtedly were something in conference, added nothing to me. But on the contrary, when they saw that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter with that of the circumcision:(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought likewise effectually in me toward the Gentiles:) And when James, and Cephas, and John, who undoubtedly were pillars, knew the grace that was given to me, they gave the right-hands of fellowships to me and Barnabas, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision: Only they desired that we would be mindful of the poor, the same which I also was forward to do. But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned. For before certain men came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. And the other Jews also dissembled with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation. But when I saw, that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If thou being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to judaize? We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, Even we (knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ) have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified. But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin? God forbid. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may live to God. I am crucified with Christ, and I live no longer, but Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not make void the grace of God; for if righteousness is by the law, then Christ died in vain. O thoughtless Galatians, who hath bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you! This only would I learn of you, Did you receive the Spirit, by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Are ye so thoughtless? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? Have ye suffered so many things in vain? If it be yet in vain? Doth he that ministreth the Spirit to you, and worketh miracles among you, do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? As Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness. Know then, that they who are of faith, these are the sons of Abraham. And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared before the glad tidings to Abraham, In thee shall all the nations be blessed. So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all the things which are written in the book of the law, to do them. But that none is justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident; for the just shall live by faith. Now the law is not of faith; but the man that doeth them, shall live by them. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:) That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. I speak after the manner of men: though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, none disannulleth or addeth thereto. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. And this I say, the covenant which was before confirmed of God through Christ, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect. For if the inheritance be by the law, it is no more by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise. Wherefore then was the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made: and it was ordained by angels, in the hand of a mediator. Now the mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one. Is then the law against the promises of God? God forbid. But if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness would have been by the law. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up together unto the faith which was to be revealed. Wherefore the law was our school-master unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But faith being come, we are no longer under a school-master. For ye are all sons of God by faith in Jesus Christ. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye are Christ's, then are ye the seed of Abraham, and heirs according to the promise. Now I say the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; But is under tutors and stewards, till the time appointed by the father. So we also, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem those under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. Indeed then, when ye knew not God, ye served them that by nature are not gods. But now having known God, or rather being known of God, how turn ye back to the weak and beggarly elements, to which ye desire to be in bondage again? Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid for you, lest I have laboured upon you in vain. Brethren, I beseech you, be ye as I am; for I also am as ye were: ye have not injured me at all. Ye know how though infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you at first. And ye did not slight or disdain my temptation which was in the flesh, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? For I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes, and have given them to me. Am I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. Now it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only while I am present with you. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Christ be formed in you, I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. Tell me, ye that would be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written, Abraham had two sons, one by the bond-woman, another by the free-woman. And he of the bond-woman was born after the flesh, but he of the free-woman by promise. Which things are an allegory; for these are the two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem that now is, and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.(For it is written, Rejoice thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for the desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband. Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise. But as then, he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so it is now also. But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and her son; for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bondage. Behold, I Paul say unto you, If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, he is a debtor to do the whole law. Christ is become of no effect to you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love. Ye did run well: who hath hindered you, that ye should not obey the truth? This persuasion cometh not from him that called you. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded; but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. But if I, brethren, preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the offence of the cross ceased. I would they were even cut off that trouble you. Brethren, ye have been called to liberty: only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed ye be not consumed one of another. I say then, walk by the Spirit, and fulfil not the desire of the flesh. For the flesh desireth against the Spirit, but the Spirit desireth against the flesh (these are contrary to each other) that ye may not do the things which ye would. But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, strifes, divisions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of which I tell you before (as I have also told you in time past) that they who practise such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity, Meekness, temperance; against such there is no law. And they that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with its affections and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Be not desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault, ye who are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. For if any man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. For every man shall bear his own burden. Let him that is taught in the word impart to him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that also shall he reap. For he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. But let us not be weary of well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. Therefore as we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men; but especially to them who are of the houshold of faith. Ye see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand. As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised: only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. For neither they who are circumcised keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision is any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. From henceforth let none trouble me; for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. Brethren, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your Spirit. Amen.Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus, Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places through Christ, As he hath chosen us through him, before the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and blameless before him in love, Having predestinated us to the adoption of sons to himself by Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, To the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he hath freely accepted us through the beloved, By whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the riches of his grace, Wherein he hath abounded toward us, in all wisdom and prudence, Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in himself, That in the dispensation of the fulness of the times, he might gather together into one in Christ all things which are in heaven, and which are in earth, In him through whom we also have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the counsel of his own will, That we who first believed in Christ, might be to the praise of his glory. In whom ye likewise believed, after ye had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom having believed, ye were also sealed by that Holy Spirit of promise, Who is an earnest of our inheritance, till the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory. Wherefore I also, since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all saints, Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, through the knowledge of him. The eyes of your understanding being inlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, And what the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the energy of his mighty power, Which he wrought in Christ, raising him from the dead; and he hath made him sit at his own right-hand in heavenly places, Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. And he hath put all things under his feet, and hath given him to be head over all things to the church, Which is his body; who is the fulness of him that filleth all in all. And he hath quickened you, who were dead in trespasses and sins, Wherein ye formerly walked, according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience: Among whom also we all had our conversation in time past, in the desires of the flesh, doing the will of the flesh and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the others. But God who is rich in mercy, through his great love wherewith he loved us, Hath quickened us together with Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses, (by grace ye are saved) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places through Christ Jesus: That he might shew in the ages to come the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace ye are saved through faith; and this not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created through Christ Jesus unto good works, which God had before prepared, that we might walk in them. Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh (who were called the uncircumcision, by that which is called the circumcision made with hands in the flesh) Were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise; having no hope, and without God in the world. But now through Christ Jesus, ye who were once far off are brought nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, he who hath made both one, having broken down the middle wall of partition, Having abolished by his flesh the enmity, the law of commandments, through his decrees, that he might make the two one new man in himself, so making peace: And might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby. And he came and preached peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh. For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. Therefore ye are no longer strangers, and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints and of the houshold of God, Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, On whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord: On whom ye also are built together, for an habitation of God through the Spirit. For this cause I Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, (Seeing ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, given me to you ward, That by revelation he made known to me the mystery: as I wrote before in few words, By reading which ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ: Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed to the holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, That the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and joint-partakers of his promise by Christ through the gospel, Of which I have been made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power. Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ. And to let all men see, what is the fellowship of the mystery, which was hidden from the beginning of the world by God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: That the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in heavenly places, According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord, By whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in him. Wherefore I intreat you not to faint at my afflictions for you, which is your glory. For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,(Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named) That he would give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, That Christ may dwell in your heart by faith: That being rooted and grounded in love, ye may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, And to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God. Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, To him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you, to walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye are called, With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love, Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit, by the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, as ye are also called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism: One God, and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all. But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, Having ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.(Now that he ascended, what is it, but that he also descended first to the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same that ascended also, far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, to the edifying the body of Christ; Till we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: That we may be no longer children, fluctuating to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men, by cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive: But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, who is the head, even Christ: From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted, by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every member, maketh increase of the body, to the edifying of itself in love. This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles, in the vanity of your mind: Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, by the ignorance that is in them, through the hardness of their hearts: Who being past feeling, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ; Since ye have heard him, and been taught by him, (as the truth is in Jesus) To put off, concerning your former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitful desires: To be renewed in the spirit of your mind; And to put on the new man, which is created after God, in righteousness and true holiness. Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour; for we are members one of another. Be ye angry, and sin not; let not the sun go down upon your wrath, Neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole, steal no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt discourse proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking be put away from you with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted; forgiving one another; as God also for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Be ye therefore followers of God, as beloved children: And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savour. But let not fornication, or any uncleanness, or covetousness be even named among you, as becometh saints: Neither obscenity, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not convenient, but rather thanksgiving. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, or unclean person, or covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with vain words; for because of these things the wrath of God cometh upon the sons of disobedience. Be ye not therefore partakers with them. For ye were once darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord: walk as children of light; (The fruit of the light is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth:) Searching what is acceptable to the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak the things which are done by them in secret. But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise men, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what is the will of the Lord. And be not drunken with wine, wherein is excess; but be ye filled with the Spirit, Speaking to each other in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your hearts unto the Lord; Giving thanks always for all things to God even the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife, as Christ also is head of the church:(and he is the Saviour of the body) Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify it (having cleansed it by the washing of water) through the word: That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, that it may be holy and unblamable. Men ought so to love their wives as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself. Now no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery; I mean, concerning Christ and the church. But let every one of you in particular so love his wife as himself: and let the wife reverence her husband. Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right. Honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise) That it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live long upon the earth. And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the instruction and discipline of the Lord. Servants, obey your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as unto the Lord: Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, With good will doing service as unto the Lord, and not to men: Knowing that whatsoever good each man doth, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be a servant or free. And ye masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatning, knowing that your master is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him. Finally, brethren, be strong through the Lord, and through the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the world, of the darkness of this age, against wicked spirits in heavenly places. Wherefore take to you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, And having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, Praying alway by the Spirit with all prayer and supplication, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints, And for me that utterance may be given me, by the opening my mouth to make known boldly the mystery of the gospel, For which I am an ambassador in bonds, that I may speak boldly therein, as I ought to speak. But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things. Whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons, Grace be unto you, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God upon every mention of you, Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all with joy, For your fellowship in the gospel, from the first day until now: Being persuaded of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ, As it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, who were all partakers of my grace, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel. For God is my witness, how I long for you all, with the bowels of Jesus Christ. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more, in all knowledge and in all spiritual sense, That ye may try the things that are excellent, that ye may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ, Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Christ Jesus, to the glory and praise of God. Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things concerning me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel: So that my bonds in Christ have been made manifest in the whole palace, and to all others: And many of the brethren trusting in the Lord through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word without fear. Some indeed preach Christ even through envy and strife; but some through good will. The one preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: But the others out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. What then? still every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ: According to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also, Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But if I am to live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour, and what I should chuse, I know not. For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, for it is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more needful for you. And being persuaded of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith: That your rejoicing for me may abound through Christ Jesus, by my presence with you again. Only let your behaviour be worthy the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear concerning you, that ye stand fast, in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel, And in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation. This also is of God. For to you it is given, with regard to Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him: Having the same conflict, which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me. If there be then any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies; Fulfil ye my joy, that ye think the same thing, having the same love, being of one soul, of one mind. Do nothing through strife or vain-glory, but in lowliness of mind, esteem each the others better than themselves. Look not every one at his own things, but every one also at the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; Yet emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above every name, That at the name of Jesus every knee might bow, of those in heaven, and those on earth, and those under the earth: And every tongue might confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God that worketh in you according to his good pleasure, both to will and to do. Do all things without murmurings and disputings: That ye may be blameless and simple, the sons of God, unrebukable, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, Holding fast the word of life, that I may glory in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all. For the same cause joy ye likewise, and rejoice with me. Now I trust in the Lord Jesus, to send Timotheus to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged, when I know your state. For I have none like-minded, who will naturally care for what concerneth you. For all seek their own, not the things of Christ. But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with his father, he hath served with me in the gospel. Him therefore I hope to send, as soon as ever I know how it will go with me. But I trust in the Lord, that I also myself shall come shortly. Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and companion in labour and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, and him that ministered to my need. For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he was sick. He was indeed sick nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me likewise, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. I have sent him therefore the more willingly, that ye seeing him again may rejoice, and that I also may be the less sorrowful. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and honour such. Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his own life, to supply your deficiency of service toward me. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not tedious to me, and it is safe for you. Beware of dogs, beware of evil-workers, beware of the concision, For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. Though I might have confidence: if any man think that he may have confidence in the flesh, I more: Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, touching the law, a Pharisee; Touching zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteousness, which is by the law, blameless. But whatsoever things were gain to me, those I have accounted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I account all things to be loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do account them but dung, that I may gain Christ, And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith: That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death: If by any means I may attain unto the resurrection of the dead. Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected: but I pursue, if I may apprehend that, for which I was also apprehended by Christ Jesus. Brethren, I do not account myself to have apprehended. But one thing I do, forgetting the things that are behind, and reaching forth unto the things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded; and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. But whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. Brethren, be ye followers together of me, and mark them who walk so as ye have us for an example.(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame; who mind earthly things) For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, Who will transform our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, acccording to the mighty working, whereby he is able even to subject all things to himself. Therefore, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved. I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to be of one mind in the Lord. And I intreat thee also, true yoke-fellow, help those women who laboured together with me in the gospel, with both Clement and my other fellow-labourers, whose names are in the book of life. Rejoice in the Lord always: again, I say, rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to all men; the Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God: And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things: Which also ye have learned and received, and heard and seen in me; these do: and the God of peace shall be with you. I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful; but ye lacked opportunity. Not that I speak in respect of want; for I have learned in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound, every where and in every thing I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to want. I can do all things through Christ strengthening me. Nevertheless ye have done well, that ye did communicate to me in my affliction. And ye know likewise, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated to me in respect of giving and receiving but you only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to my necessities. Not that I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received of Epaphroditus the things which came from you, an odour of a sweet smell, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God. And my God shall supply all your need, according to his riches in glory through Christ Jesus. Now unto our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me salute you. All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of C?sar's houshold. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus a brother, To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at Colosse, grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, (praying always for you, Hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of your love to all the saints) For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which ye heard before in the word of truth, Which is come to you, as also it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it hath done likewise among you, from the day ye heard it, and knew the grace of God in truth: As ye likewise learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you: Who also declared to us your love in the spirit. For this cause from the day we heard it, we do not cease to pray also for you, and to desire that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; That ye may walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness: Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to partake of the inheritance of the saints in light. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the first begotten of every creature. For through him were created all things, that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible; whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist, And he is the head of his body the church; who is the beginning, the first-begotten from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father, that all fulness should dwell in him: And by him to reconcile all things to himself (having made peace by him, through the blood of the cross ) whether things on earth, or things in heaven. And you that were once alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, he hath now reconciled, By the body of his flesh, through death, to present you holy, and spotless, and unreproveable in his sight: If ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and are not removed from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard, which is preached to every creature that is under heaven, whereof I Paul am made a minister. Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ for his body, which is the church: Of which I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God, which is given me for you, fully to preach the word of God: The mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations; but now is manifested to his saints: To whom among the Gentiles it was the will of God to make known, what is the riches of this glorious mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, that we may present every man perfect through Christ Jesus. For which also I labour, striving according to his mighty working, who worketh in me mightily. For I would have you know, how great a conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh: That their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love, even unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, both the Father and Christ, In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And this I say, that no man may beguile you with inticing words. For though I am absent from you in the flesh, yet I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing to behold your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him; Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man make a prey of you through philosophy and empty deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of this world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are filled by him, who is the head of all principality and power. By whom also ye are circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ: Buried with him in baptism, by which ye are also risen with him, through the faith of the operation of God, who raised him from the dead. And you who were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses, Having blotted out by his decrees the hand-writing against us, which was contrary to us; and having nailed it to his cross, he took it out of the way. And having spoiled the principalities and powers, he exposed them openly, triumphing over them in him. Let none therefore judge you in meat, or drink, or in respect of a feast-day, or of the new-moon, or of sabbath-days: Which are shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. Let none defraud you of your reward by a voluntary humility and worship of angels, intruding into the things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, And not holding the head, from which all the body being nourished and knit together, by the joints and ligaments, increaseth with the increase of God. Therefore if ye are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as living in the world, receive ye ordinances,(Touch not, taste not, handle not: All which are to perish in the using) after the commandments and doctrines of men? Which things (though they have indeed a shew of wisdom, in voluntary worship and humility, and not sparing the body) yet are not of any value, but are to the satisfying of the flesh. If ye then are risen with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ sitteth at the right-hand of God. Set your affections on the things above, not the things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry: For which things the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: In which ye also once walked, when ye lived in them. But now put ye also all these things off, anger, wrath, ill-nature, evil speaking, filthy discourse out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds, And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him: Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision; barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free; but Christ is all, and in all. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering: Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these put on love, which is the bond of perfection: And the peace of God shall rule in your hearts, to which also ye are called in one body: and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart unto the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father through him. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands (as is fit) in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well-pleasing to the Lord. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men: Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ. But he that doth wrong, shall receive for the wrong he hath done; and there is no respect of persons. Masters, give your servants that which is just and equitable, knowing that ye also have a master in heaven. Continue in prayer, and watch therein with thanksgiving: Withal, praying likewise for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ: for which I am also in bonds: That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every one. All my concerns will Tychicus declare to you, a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord: Whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that he might know your state and comfort your hearts, With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you: they will make known to you all things that are done here. Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas; (touching whom ye have received directions, if he come to you, receive him,) And Jesus, called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these are the only fellow-workers unto the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me. Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayer, that ye may stand, perfect and filled, with all the will of God. For I bear him witness, that he hath a great zeal for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis. Luke the beloved physician and Demas salute you. Salute the brethren at Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house. And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. And say to Archippus, Take heed that thou fulfil the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord. The salutation of me Paul by my own hand. Be mindful of my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, Grace be unto you and Peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God always for you all (making mention of you in our prayers, Remembring without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of our God and Father:) Knowing, beloved brethren, your election of God. For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also with power, and with the Holy Ghost, and with much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you, for your sake. And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost. So that ye became examples to all that believed in Macedonia and Achaia. For from you the word of the Lord sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith toward God went abroad in every place also, so that we need not speak any thing. For they themselves declare concerning us, what manner of entrance to you we had, and how ye turned from idols to God, to serve the living and true God, And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he hath raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come. For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance to you, that it was not in vain: But even after we had suffered before, and had been shamefully intreated at Philippi, as ye know, we were bold thro' our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention. For our exhortation is not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile. But as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who trieth our hearts. For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness: God is witness: Nor sought we glory of men, neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burdensome, as the Apostles of Christ. But we were gentle in the midst of you, even as a nurse cherisheth her own children. So, loving you tenderly, we were ready to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but our own souls also, because ye were dear to us. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God. Ye are witnesses and God, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved among you that believe: As ye know how we exhorted and comforted every one of you, as a father his own children, And charged you to walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory. For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, even because when ye received the word of God from us, ye received it, not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, who likewise effectually worketh in you that believe. For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God in Christ Jesus, which are in Judea; for ye also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they likewise from the Jews: Who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us: and they please not God, and are contrary to all men. Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: but wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, laboured with great desire the more abundantly to see your face. Wherefore we would have come to you (even I Paul) once and again, but Satan hindered us. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not ye also before our Lord Jesus at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy. Therefore when we could bear no longer, we thought good to be left at Athens alone, And sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God and our fellow-worker in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith, That no one might be moved by these afflictions; for ye know that we are appointed hereto. For when we were with you we told you before, we should be afflicted; as it came to pass, and ye know. Therefore when I could bear no longer, I sent to know your faith, left by any means the tempter should have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. But now when Timotheus was come to us from you, and had brought us the good tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, as we also to see you: Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you, in, all our affliction and distress by your faith. For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sake before our God? Night and day praying exceedingly, that we may see your face, and perfect that which is wanting in your faith. Now our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way unto you. And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love towards one another and towards all men, as we also do towards you, That he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness (before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ) with all his saints. It remaineth then, brethren, that we beseech and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, that ye abound therein more and more. For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication; That every one of you know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; Not in passionate desire, as the Gentiles who know not God. That none circumvent or defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger of all these things, as we have also told you before and testified. For God hath not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness. He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man but God; who hath also given you his Holy Spirit. Touching brotherly love, we need not write to you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia; but we exhort you, brethren, that ye increase more and more, And that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, as we commanded you; That ye may walk decently toward them that are without, and may want nothing. Now we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no hope. For if we believe, that Jesus died and rose again, so will God bring with him those also that sleep in Christ. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. But of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write to you. For ye yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. When they say, peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all children of the light and children of the day: we are not children of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep as the others, but let us awake and keep awake. For they that sleep, sleep in the night, and they that are drunken are drunken in the night. But let us who are of the day keep awake, having put on the breast-plate of faith and love, and for an helmet the hope of salvation. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, Who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we may live together with him. Wherefore comfort one another and edify one another, as also ye do. Now we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you, And to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake, and be at peace among yourselves. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be long suffering toward all men. See that none render to any man evil for evil, but ever follow that which is good, both to one another and to all men. Rejoice evermore: Pray without ceasing: In every thing give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil. And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly: and may the whole of you, the spirit and the soul and the body, be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. Brethren, pray for us. Salute all the brethren with an holy kiss. I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the brethren. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be unto you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ. We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth. So that we ourselves glory of you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and sufferings which ye endure: A manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be accounted, worthy of the kingdom of God; for which also ye suffer. Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recompence affliction to them that afflict you. And to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire, taking vengeance on them who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all that believe (now that our testimony was believed among you) in that day. To this end we pray always for you, that our God would make you worthy of this calling, and fulfill in you all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power; That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. Now I beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him, That ye be not soon shaken in mind or terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come, unless the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God as God, declaring himself that he is God. Remember ye not, that I told you these things, when I was yet with you? And now ye know that which with-holdeth, that he may be revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity already worketh; only he that with-holdeth will with-hold, till he be taken out of the way. And then will that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the Spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming: Whose coming is after the mighty working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceiveableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And therefore God shall send them strong delusion, so that that they shall believe a lie, That they all may be condemned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation, thro' sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. To which he hath called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions, which ye have been taught, whether by word, or by our Epistle. Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even our Father, who hath loved us and given us everlasting consolation and good hope thro' grace, Comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work. Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as among you: And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all men have not faith. But the Lord is faithful, who will stablish and guard you from the evil one. And we trust in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and the patience of Christ. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received of us. For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you, Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing, but wrought with labour and toil, night and day, that we might not burden any of you. Not because we have not power; but that we might make ourselves an example to you, that ye might imitate us. For when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat. For we hear there are some among you who walk disorderly, doing nothing, but being busy-bodies. Now such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, to work quietly and eat their own bread. And ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing. And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all. The Salutation of Paul, with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Saviour, and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope, To Timotheus my own son in the faith, grace, mercy, peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. As I exhorted thee when I was going into Macedonia, abide at Ephesus; that thou mayest charge some to teach no other doctrine, Neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that afford questions, and not godly edifying, which is through faith. Whereas the end of the commandment is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned, From which some, having missed the mark, are turned aside to vain jangling: Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither the things they say, nor those concerning which they confidently affirm. We know, the law is good, if a man use it lawfully, Knowing this, that the law doth not lie against a righteous man; but against the lawless and disobedient, against the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and prophane, against killers of their fathers or their mothers, against murderers, Against whoremongers, sodomites, man-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to wholesome doctrine, According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I am instructed. And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, in that he accounted me faithful, having put me into the ministry, Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecuter, and a reviler; but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief. Yet for this cause I obtained mercy, that on me the chief Jesus Christ might shew all long-suffering, for a pattern to them who should hereafter believe in him to life everlasting. Now to the king of eternity, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever, Amen. This charge I commit to thee, son Timotheus, according to the prophecies which went before concerning thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare: Holding fast faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away, have made shipwreck of their faith. Among which are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. I exhort therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men: For kings and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, Who willeth all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified of in due season, Whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle, (I speak the truth, I lie not) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting: Likewise that women adorn themselves in decent apparel, with modesty and sobriety, not with curled hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment, But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection. For I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived; but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Yet she shall be saved in child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobriety. This is a faithful saying, If a man desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. A bishop therefore must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, prudent, of good behaviour, hospitable, apt to teach; Not given to wine, no striker, not desirous of filthy gain, but gentle, patient, not loving money; Ruling his own house well, having his children in subjection with all seriousness. For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God? Not a new convert, left being puffed up, he fall into the condemnation of the devil. He ought also to have a good report from them that are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. Likewise the deacons must be serious, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not desirous of filthy gain: Holding fast the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. And let these be proved first, then let them minister, being found blameless. In like manner their wives must be serious, not slanderers, vigilant, faithful in all things. Let the deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. For they that have used the office of a deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree and much boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee shortly: But if I tarry, that thou mayst know how to behave in the house of God, which is the church of the living God. The mystery of godliness is the pillar and ground of the truth, and without controversy a great thing: God was manifested in the flesh, was justified by the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up into glory. But the spirit saith expresly, that in the later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, By the hypocrisy of them that speak lies, having their own consciences seared as with an hot iron: Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving. For it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer. If thou remind the brethren of these things, thou wilt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourishing them with the words of faith, and of the good doctrine whereto thou hast attained. But avoid profane and old wives fables, and exercise thyself unto godliness. For bodily exercise profiteth a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the present life, and of that which is to come. This is faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation. For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of them that believe. These things command and teach. Let no one despise thy youth; but be a pattern to them that believe, in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Till I come, give thyself to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Meditate on these things; be wholly in them, that thy profiting may appear in all things. Take heed to thyself and to thy teaching: continue in them, for in so doing thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee. Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father, the younger men as brethren; The elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity. Honour widows that are widows indeed. But if any widow have children or grand children, let these learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God. Now she that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. And enjoin these things, that they may be blameless. But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own family, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel. Let not a widow be chosen under threescore years old, having been the wife of one husband, Well reported of for good works, if she hath brought up children, if she hath lodged strangers, if she hath washed the feet of the saints, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work. But the younger widows refuse; for when they are waxed wanton against Christ, they want to marry; Having condemnation, because they have rejected their first faith. And withal they learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers and busy bodies, speaking what they ought not. I counsel therefore the younger women to marry, bear children, guide the family, give no occasion of reproach to the adversary. For some are already turned aside after Satan. If any believing man or woman hath widows, let them relieve them; and let not the church be burthened, that it may relieve them that are widows indeed. Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and teaching. For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward. Against an elder receive not an accusation, unless by two or three witnesses. Those that sin, rebuke before all, that the rest may fear. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudging, doing nothing by partiality. Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither partake of other mens sins; keep thyself pure. Drink water no longer, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thy frequent infirmities. Some mens sins are manifest before-hand, going before to judgment: and some they follow after. In like manner the good works also of some are manifest; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. Let as many servants as are under the yoke, account their masters worthy of all honour; lest the name of God and his doctrine be blasphemed. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them a service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. If any teach otherwise, and consent not to sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is after godliness, He is puffed up, knowing nothing, but being sick of questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, contention, evil speakings, evil surmisings, Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing the gain is godliness. From such withdraw thyself. But godliness with content is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world: it is manifest that neither can we carry any thing out. Having then food and covering, with these let us be content. But they that desire to be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting, have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which thou art called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses. I charge thee, before God, who quickneth all things, and Jesus Christ, who witnessed a good confession before Pontius Pilate, That thou keep the commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, Which in his times the blessed and only Potentate will shew, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: Who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no man hath seen, neither can see; to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen. Charge the rich in this world not to be high-minded, neither to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy: To do good, to be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, Treasuring up for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. O Timotheus, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding prophane, empty babblings, and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called: Which some professing have erred from the faith. Grace be with thee.Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of eternal life, which is by Jesus Christ, To Timotheus, my beloved son, grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience, that I have remembrance of thee in my prayers without ceasing night and day, Longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; Remembering the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; I am persuaded in thee also. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, to stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the laying on of my hands. For God hath not given us the Spirit of fear, but of power, and love, and sobriety. Therefore be not thou ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God, Who hath saved and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began; But is now made manifest, by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. For which cause also I suffer these things: yet I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have trusted, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him, until that day. Hold fast the pattern of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. The good thing which is committed to thee keep, through the Holy Spirit, who dwelleth in us. This thou knowest, that all who are in Asia are turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. The Lord give mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: But when he was at Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me. The Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day: And in how many things he served me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. Thou therefore, my son, be strong through the grace which is by Jesus Christ. And the things which thou hast heard from me before many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. Thou therefore endure affliction, is a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth intangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath inlisted him. And if a man strive, he is not crowned, unless he strive lawfully. The husbandman, that laboureth first, must be partaker of the fruits. Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. Remember Jesus Christ of the seed of David, raised from the dead according to my gospel; For which I endure affliction even unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God is not bound. Therefore I suffer all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is through Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. It is a faithful saying: if we are dead with him, we shall also live with him: If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he will also deny us: If we believe not, he remaineth faithful; he cannot deny himself. Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord, not to strive about words, to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. Be diligent to present thyself unto God approved a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But avoid profane empty babblings; for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their word will eat as a gangrene; of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus, Who have erred from the faith, saying, The resurrection is already past, and overthrow the faith of some. But the foundation of God standeth fast, having this seal, The Lord knoweth those that are his: and, Let every one who nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of stone; and some to honour, some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, consecrated and fit for the master's use, prepared for every good work. Flee also youthful desires; but follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace with them that call upon the Lord, out of a pure heart. But avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strife: And a servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle toward all men, apt to teach, patient of evil, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if haply God may give them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth; And they may awake out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. But know this, that in the last days grievous times will come. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, arrogant, proud, evil-speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, Without natural affection, covenant-breakers, slanderers, intemperate, fierce, despisers of good men, Traitors, rash, puffed up, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness but denying the power of it. From these also turn away. For of these are they who creep into houses, and captivate silly women laden with sins, led away by various desires, Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth: men of corrupt minds, void of judgment as to the faith. But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, intention, faith, long-suffering, love, patience, Persecutions, afflictions, which befel me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured; but the Lord delivered me out of all. Yea and all that are resolved to live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and been fully assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them, And that from an infant thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, thro' faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is inspired of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the quick and dead at his appearing and his kingdom, Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; convince, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and teaching. For the time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine, but will heap to themselves teachers, according to their own desires, having itching ears. And they will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables. But watch thou in all things, endure affliction, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered up, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge will render me in that day, and not to me only, but to all them likewise that have loved his appearing. Do thy diligence to come to me shortly. For Demas hath forsaken me, loving the present world, and is gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for service. Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. When thou comest, bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments. Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; the Lord will reward him according to his works. Of whom be thou also aware; for he hath greatly withstood our words. At my first defence no man was with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge? But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the preaching might be fully known, even that all nations might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory for ever, and ever. Amen. Salute Aquila and Priscilla and the family of Onesiphorus. Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I have left at Miletus sick. Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.Paul a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in things concerning the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is after godliness, In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began; And he hath in due time manifested his word, thro' the preaching wherewith I am intrusted, according to the commandment of God our Saviour: To Titus my own son after the common faith, grace, mercy, peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest set in order the things which remain, and ordain elders in every city, as I appointed thee: If a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of luxury or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not passionate, not given to wine, no striker, not desirous of filthy gain: But a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, prudent, just, holy, temperate, Holding fast the faithful word, as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. For there are many unruly vain-talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision, Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole families, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of filthy gain. One of themselves, a prophet of their own, hath said, The Cretans are always liars, evil wild-beasts, lazy gluttons. This witness is true; therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. To the clean all things are clean; but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is clean; but both their understanding and conscience are defiled. They profess to know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and void of judgment as to every good work. But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine, That the aged men be vigilant, serious, prudent, sound in faith, love, patience: That the aged women in like manner, be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things: That they instruct the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their chidren, Discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. The young men likewise exhort to be discreet, In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works, in doctrine, uncorruptness, seriousness, Sound speech that cannot be reproved; that he who is on the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us. Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, to please them in all things, not answering again, Not stealing, but shewing all good fidelity, that they may in all things adorn the gospel of God our Saviour. For the saving grace of God hath appeared to all men, Teaching us, that, having renounced ungodliness and all wordly desires, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present world, Looking for the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God, even our Saviour Jesus Christ. Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority: let no man despise thee. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work: To speak evil of no man, not to be quarrelsome, to be gentle, shewing all meekness toward all men. For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, inslaved to various desires and pleasures, living in wickedness and envy, hateful, hating one another: But when the kindness and philanthropy of God our Saviour appeared, Not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. Which he poured forth richly upon us, through Jesus Christ our Saviour, That, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, to the end that they who have believed in God, be careful to excel in good works: these things are good and profitable to men. But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. An heretic after a first and second admonition reject, Knowing that such an one is perverted and sinneth, being self-condemned. When I shall send Artemas or Tychicus to thee, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis; for I have determined to winter there. Send forward with diligence Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, that they may want nothing. And let ours also learn to excell in good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timotheus a brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-labourer, And to the beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church which is in thy house: Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, (Hearing of thy faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and love toward all saints) That the communication of thy faith may become effectual, by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you through Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ, to enjoin thee what is convenient, Yet out of love I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also the prisoner of Jesus Christ. I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, Who was formerly unprofitable to thee, but now profitable to thee and me, Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is my own bowels: Whom I would have retained with me, to serve me in thy stead, in the bonds of the gospel. But I would do nothing without thy consent; that thy good deed might not be, as it were, by constraint, but willingly. And perhaps for this end was he separated for a season, that thou mightest have him for ever; No longer as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me; and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord? If therefore thou accountest me a partner, receive him as myself. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee any thing, put that to my account. I Paul have written with my own hand; I will repay it; not to say unto thee, that thou owest also thyself to me besides. Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ. Having confidence of thy obedience I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say. Withal prepare me also a lodging; for I trust I shall be given to you through your prayers. Epaphras my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus saluteth you, Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-labourers. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake of old to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his Son; Whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom he also made the worlds: Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and sustaining all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high, Being made so much higher than the angels, as he hath by inheritance a more excellent name than they. For to which of the angels did he ever say, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? And again, When he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. But unto the Son, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness: Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. And, Thou, Lord, hast in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. But to which of the angels did he ever say, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? Are they not all ministring spirits, sent forth to serve for them who shall inherit salvation? Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence: How shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation, which began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that had heard him? God also bearing them witness by signs, and wonders, and various miracles, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will. For he hath not subjected to the angels the world to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels, thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands. Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. Now in putting all things in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him: but now we do not yet see all things put under him. But we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour, for the suffering of death, who was made a little lower than the angels, that by the grace of God he might taste death for every man. For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the captain of their salvation through sufferings. For both he that sanctifieth, and all they that are sanctified, are of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, Saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. And again, I will put my trust in him: And again, Behold I and the children whom God hath given me. Since then the children partake of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil: And deliver them, as many as through fear of death, were all their life-time subject to bondage. For verily he taketh not hold of angels, but he taketh hold of the seed of Abraham. Wherefore it behoved him to be made in all things like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-priest, in things pertaining to God, to expiate the sins of the people. For in that he hath suffered, being tempted himself, he is able to succour them that are tempted. Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high-priest of our profession, Jesus, Faithful to him that appointed him, as was also Moses in all his house. For this person was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he that hath builded it hath more honour than the house. Now every house is built by some one: but he that built all things is God. And Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of the things, which were to be afterwards spoken: But Christ as a Son over his own house, whose house we are, if we hold fast the confidence and the glorying of hope, firm to the end. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith) To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation , in the day of temptation in the wilderness, Where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. Therefore I was grieved with that generation and said, They always err in their hearts, and they have not know my ways. So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest. Take heed, brethren, left there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God: But exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin:(For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end) While it is said; To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. For who, when they had heard, provoked God? Were they not all that came out of Egypt by Moses? And with whom was he grieved forty years? Was it not with them who had sinned? Whose carcases fell in the wilderness? And to whom sware he, that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? So we see, they could not enter in, because of unbelief. Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entring into his rest, any of us should altogether come short of it. For unto us hath the gospel been preached as well as unto them; but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixt with faith in those that heard it. For we that have believed, do enter into the rest; as he said, I have sworn in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest, though the works were finished from the foundation of the world. For he saith thus in a certain place, of the seventh day , And God rested on the seventh day from all his works: And in this again, They shall not enter into my rest. Seeing then it remaineth that some enter into it, and they to whom the gospel was preached before, entered not in because of unbelief, He again, after so long a time, fixeth a certain day, saying by David, To-day; as it was said before, To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. For if Joshua had given them the rest, he would not have afterward spoken of another day. There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God. For he that hath entered into his rest, hath himself also ceased from his works, as God did from his. Let us labour, therefore, to enter into that rest, lest any one should fall, after the same example of unbelief. For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder both of the soul and spirit, both of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Having therefore a great high priest, that is passed thro' the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession, For we have not an high-priest who cannot sympathize with our infirmities, but who was in all points tempted like as we are: yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. For every high priest being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins, Who can have compassion on the ignorant and the wandering, seeing he himself also is compassed with infirmity, And because hereof it behoveth him, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins. And no one taketh this honour to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest, but he that said to him , Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedeck: Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and being heard from his fears; Tho' he was a son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered, And being perfected, became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him, Called of God an high priest, after the order of Melchisedek. Concerning whom we have many things to say, and hard to be explained, seeing ye are become dull of hearing. For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again, which are the first principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unexperienced in the word of righteousness; for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them of full age, to them who have their senses exercised by habit to discern both good and evil. Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith in God, Of the doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. And this we will do, if God permit. For it is impossible for those who were once inlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and been made partakers of the Holy Ghost, And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, And have fallen away, to renew them again unto repentance, seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God. But that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and nigh unto a curse, whose end is to be burned. But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. But we desire that every one of you would shew unto the end the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope, That ye be not slothful, but followers of them, who through faith and long suffering inherited the promises. For when God made the promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself, Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all contradiction. Wherefore God being willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his counsel, interposed by an oath: That by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before us: Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil, Whither Jesus our fore-runner is entered for us, made an high-priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek. For this Melchisedek king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all the spoils; being by interpretation, first king of righteousness, and then king of Salem also, which is king of peace; Without father, without mother, without pedigree, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but being made like the son of God, remaineth a priest continually. Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils, And verily they of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment (according to the law) to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brethren, tho' they come out of the loins of Abraham. But he whose pedigree is not from them, took tythes of Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises: And without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the greater. And here men that die receive tithes: but there, he of whom it is witnessed, that he liveth. And even Levi, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes (so to speak) thro' Abraham. For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedek met him. If then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law) what farther need was there that another priest should rise, after the order of Melchisedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is also necessarily a change of the law. For he of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man attended on the altar. For it is evident, that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood. And it is still far more evident, because another priest is raised up, after the likeness of Melchidek, Who was made not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. For it is testified, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek. For verily there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by which we draw nigh to God. And in as much as not without an oath he was made priest: (For those priests were made without an oath, but this with an oath, by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek:) Of so much better a covenant was Jesus made a surety. And they truly were many priests, because they were hindered by death from continuing. But this, because he continueth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth not away. Wherefore he is able also, to save them to the uttermost who come to God thro' him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. For such an high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens: Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself. For the law maketh men high priests that have infirmity; but the word of the oath which was since the law, maketh the son, who is consecrated for evermore. The sum of what hath been spoken is, We have such an high priest, who is set down at the right-hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, A minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath fixed and not man. For every high priest is ordained to offer up gifts and sacrifices; whence it was necessary, that this also should have somewhat to offer. For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, there being priests that offer gifts, according to the law, Who serve after the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God, when he was about to make the tabernacle; for, saith he, See thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewed thee on the mount. And now he hath obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much better a covenant he is a mediator of, which is established upon better promises. For if the first had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second. For finding fault with them he saith, Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when I will finish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. And they shall not teach every one his neighbour, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. In saying, a new covenant, he hath antiquated the first; now that which is antiquated and decayed, is ready to vanish away. And verily the first covenant also had ordinances of worship and a worldly sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, in which was the candlestick, and the table, and the shew-bread; which is called The holy place. And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called The holy of holies, Having the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, overlaid round about with gold, wherein was a golden pot having the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant: And over it were the Cherubim of glory, shadowing the mercy-seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. Now these things being thus prepared, the priests go always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing their services. But into the second, only the high-priest once a year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself and the errors of the people: The Holy Ghost evidently shewing this, that the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was still subsisting, Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, which could not perfect the worshiper as to his conscience, Only with meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed till the time of reformation. But Christ being come, an high-priest of good things to come, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this building, And not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God? And for this end he is the Mediator of a new covenant, that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. For where a testament is, there must also necessarily be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead; otherwise it is of no strength while the testator liveth. Whence neither was the first testament consecrated without blood. For when Moses had spoken all the commandment according to the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wooll, and hyssop, and the book itself, and sprinkled all the people, Saying, This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto you. And in like manner he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service. And almost all things are according to the law purified with blood, and withoutshedding of blood there is no remission. It was therefore necessary, that the patterns of things in heaven should be purified by these, but the heavenly things themselves by better sacrifices than these. For Christ did not enter into the holy place made with hands, the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Nor did he enter, that he might offer himself often (as the high-priest entered into the holy place every year with the blood of others.) For then he must often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the consummation of the ages hath he been manifested, to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment: So Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, will appear the second time, without sin, to them that look for him, unto salvation. For the law having a shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices which they offer year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect. Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshipers, having been once purged, would have had no more consciousness of sins. But in those sacrifices, there is a commemoration of sins every year. For it is impossible, that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. Therefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou hast not chosen, but a body hast thou prepared for me. Burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast not delighted in. Then I said, Lo I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God. Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings and offering for sin thou hast not chosen, neither delighted in, which are offered by the law: Then said he, Lo, I come, to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second: By which will we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministring and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: But he having offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down at the right hand of God, From thenceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. And this the Holy Ghost also witnesseth to us, for after he had said before, This is the covenant which I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their hearts, and write them in their minds, And their sins, and their iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. Having therefore, brethren, free liberty to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, And having an high-priest over the house of God; Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised) And let us consider one another, to provoke one another to love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. For when we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which will devour the adversaries. He that despised the law of Moses died without mercy, under two or three witnesses. Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant, by which he hath been sanctified, an unholy thing, and done despite to the spirit of grace? For we know him that hath said, Vengeance is mine; I will recompence: and again, The Lord will judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. But call ye to mind the former days, in which, after ye were inlightened, ye endured so great a conflict of sufferings: Partly being made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions; partly being partakers with them who were so used. For ye sympathized with my bonds, and received with joy the spoiling of your goods, knowing that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise. For yet a little while, and he that cometh will come and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith; but if he draw back, my soul hath no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back to perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. Now faith is the subsistence of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. And by it the elders obtained a good testimony. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were made of things which do not appear. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it, being dead he yet speaketh. By faith Enoch was translated so as not to see death, and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his houshold, by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. By faith Abraham, being called to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, obeyed and went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the joint heirs of the same promise. For he looked for the city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. By faith Sarah also herself received power to conceive seed, even when she was past age, because she accounted him faithful who had promised. Therefore there sprang even from one, and him as it were dead, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand which is on the sea-shore innumerable. All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and embraced them, and confest that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth. For they who speak thus, shew plainly, that they seek their own country. And truly if they had been mindful of that from which they came out, they might have had opportunity to return. But they now desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared a city for them. By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises, offered up his only begotten son: Of whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: Accounting that God was able even to raise him from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning things to come. By Faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. By faith Joseph, when dying, made mention of the children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones. By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months, by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he looked off unto the recompence of reward. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing him that is invisible. By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first born should touch them. By faith they passed thro' the Red Sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians trying to do, were drowned. By faith the walls of Jericho, having been compassed seven days, fell down. By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with them that believed not, having received the spies with peace. And what shall I say more? For the time would fail me, to tell of Gideon, and Barak, and Sampson, and Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and the prophets: Who by faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness was made strong, became valiant in fight, put to flight armies of the aliens; Women received their dead raised to life again: others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned, were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheep-skins, in goat-skins, destitute, afflicted, tormented:(Of whom the world was not worthy) they wandered in deserts, and mountains, and dens, and caves of the earth. And all these having obtained a good testimony thro' faith, did not receive the promise, God having provided some better thing for us, that they might not be perfected without us. Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which easily besetteth us, and run with patience the race that is set before us, Looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right-hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction from sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. And yet ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh to you as to sons, My son, despise not thou the chastning of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he chastneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastning, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he, whom his father chastneth not? But if ye are without chastning, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons. Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we reverenced them: Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? For they, verily, for a few days chastned us as they thought good: but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness. Now all chastning for the present is assuredly not joyous, but grievous; yet afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby. Wherefore Lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees: And make strait paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed. Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Looking diligently, lest any one fall from the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: Lest there be any fornicator or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright: For ye know that afterward, even when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place for repentance, tho' he sought it diligently with tears. For ye are not come to the mountain that could be touched, and the burning fire, and blackness, and darkness, and tempest, And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they that heard intreated that the word might not be spoken to them any more. For they could not bear that which was commanded, If even a beast touch the mountain, let it be stoned. And so terrible was the appearance, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble. But ye are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company, To the general assembly of angels, and to the church of the first born, who are inrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that ye refuse not him that speaketh: for if they escaped not who refused him that delivered the oracle on earth, much more shall not we, who turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying , Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven. And this word, Yet once more, sheweth the removal of the things which are shaken, as being made, that the things which are not shaken may remain. Therefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us hold fast the grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. Let brotherly love continue. Forget not to entertain strangers, for hereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember them that are in bonds, as being bound with them, and them that suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. Marriage is honourable in all men, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. Let your disposition be without covetousness: be content with the things that are present; for he hath said , No, I will not leave thee: verily I will not forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man can do unto me. Remember them that had the rule over you, who spake to you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to day and for ever. Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines; for it is good, that the heart be stablished with grace, not with meats, in which they that have walked have not been profited. We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle. For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest for sin, are burnt without the camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us then go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For we have here no continuing city; but we seek one to come. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name. But to do good, and to distribute, forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they watch over your souls, as they that must give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with groans: for that is unprofitable for you. Pray for us; for we trust we have a good conscience, desiring to behave ourselves well in all things. And I beseech you to do this the more earnestly, that I may be restored to you the sooner. Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, by the blood of the everlasting covenant, Make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight thro' Christ Jesus; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation; for I have written a letter to you in few words. Know that our brother Timotheus is set at liberty, with whom, if he come soon, I will see you. Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. Grace be with you all.James a servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. My brethren, count it all joy, when ye fall into divers temptations, Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have it's perfect work, that ye may be perfect and intire, wanting nothing. If any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: But the rich, in that he is made low; because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. For the sun arose with a burning heat, and withered the grass, and the flower fell off, and the beauty of it's appearance perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. Happy is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. Let no man when he is tempted say, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own desire and inticed. Then desire having conceived, bringeth forth sin; and sin being perfected, bringeth forth death. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, descending from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first fruits of his creatures. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath. For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. Therefore laying aside all the filthiness and superfluity of wickedness, receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls. But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves: For if any one be an hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass. For he beheld himself, and went away, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh diligently into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and continueth therein, this man being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the word, this man shall be happy in his doing. If any one be ever so religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspoted from the world. My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, in fine apparel, and there come in also a poor man in dirty raiment, And ye look upon him that weareth the fine apparel, and say to him, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my footstool, Ye distinguish not in yourselves, but are become evil-reasoning judges. Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him? But ye have disgraced the poor. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to the judgment-seats? Do not they blaspheme that worthy name, by which ye are called? If ye fulfil the royal law (according to the Scripture) Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well. But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. If then thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye and so act, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. For judgment without mercy shall be to him that shewed no mercy: mercy glorieth over judgment. What doth it profit, my brethren, tho' a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or a sister be naked, and want daily food, And one of you say to them, Depart in peace; be ye warmed and filled, but give them not the things needful for the body, what doth it profit? So likewise faith, if it hath not works, is dead in itself. But one will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest there is one God: thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble. But art thou willing to know, O empty man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered up Isaac his son upon the altar? Thou seest that faith wrought together with his works, and by works was faith made perfect. And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God. Ye see then, that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. In like manner Rahab the harlot also was justified by works, having received the messengers and sent them out another way? Therefore as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive greater condemnation. For in many things we offend all. If any one offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body. Behold we put bits into the horses mouths, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body. Behold also the ships, tho' they are so great, and driven by fierce winds, yet are turned about by a very small helm, whithersoever the pilot listeth. So the tongue also is a little member, yet boasteth great things. Behold how much matter a little fire kindleth. And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: it is the tongue among the members which defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell. For every kind both of wild beasts and of birds, both of reptiles and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind. But the tongue can no man tame: it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. Therewith bless we God the Father, and therewith curse we man, made after the likeness of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. Doth a fountain send out of the same place sweet water and bitter? Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries, or a vine figs? So can no fountain yield salt water and fresh. Who is a wise and knowing man among you? Let him shew by a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter zeal and strife in your hearts, do not glory and lie against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, animal, devilish. For where bitter zeal and strife is, there is unquietness and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without dissimulation, And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace. From whence come wars and fightings among you? Is it not hence, from your pleasures that war in your members? Ye desire and have not, ye kill, and envy, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; yet ye have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may expend it on your pleasures. Ye adulterers and adultresses, know ye not, that the friendship of the world is enmity against God? Whosoever therefore desireth to be a friend of the world, is an enemy of God. Do ye think, that the scripture saith in vain, The Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth against envy? But he giveth greater grace: therefore it saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. Submit yourselves, therefore, to God: resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you: cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of God, and he will lift you up. Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law. But if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. There is one lawgiver that is able to save and to destroy: Who art thou that judgest another? Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go to such a city, and continue there a year, and traffick, and get gain: Who know not what shall be on the morrow; for what is your life? It is a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away: Instead of your saying, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that. But now ye glory in your boastings: all such glorying is evil. Therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not, to him it is sin. Go to now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered, and the canker of them shall be a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire: ye have laid up treasure in the last days. Behold the hire of your labourers who have reaped your fields, which is kept back by you, crieth: and the cries of them who have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabbaoth. Ye have lived delicately on earth, and been wanton; ye have cherished your hearts, as in a day of sacrifice. Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just: he doth not resist you. Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath patience for it, till he receive the early and the latter rain. Be ye also patient, stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord is nigh. Murmur not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned; behold the judge standeth before the door. Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering, affliction, and of patience. Behold, we count them happy that have endured. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord: for the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, lest ye fall into condemnation. Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any chearful? let him sing psalms. Is any among you sick? let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. Confess your faults one to another, brethren, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed: the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Elijah was a man of like passions with us; and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and so the land gave forth her fruit. Brethren, if any one among you err from the truth, and one convert him, Let him know, that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.Peter an Apostle of Jesus Christ to the sojourners scattered thro' Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, Elect (according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father) thro' sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied to you. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again to a living hope, by the resurrection of Christ from the dead, To an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, Who are kept by the power of God thro' faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. Wherein ye greatly rejoice, tho' now for a little while (if need be) ye are in heaviness thro' manifold temptations. That the trial of your faith, which is much more precious than gold, (that perisheth, tho' it be tried with fire) may be found unto praise, and honour, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ, Whom having not seen, ye love: in whom tho' ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls. Of which salvation the prophets enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace of God toward you. Searching what, and what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them signified, when he testified before hand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow. To whom it was revealed, that not for themselves, but for us they ministered the things which have been now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven: which things angels desire to look into. Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be watchful and hope perfectly for the grace that is brought you by the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, not conforming yourselves to your former desires, in your ignorance; But as he who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation: For it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear: Seeing ye know ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation delivered by tradition from your fathers, But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, Who verily was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you, Who thro' him believe in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope, might be in God. Having purified your souls by obeying the truth thro' the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another with a pure heart fervently: Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass: The grass is withered, and the flower thereof is fallen off; But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which is preached to you by the gospel. Wherefore laying aside all wickedness, and all guile, and dissimulation, and envies, and all evil-speakings, As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: If ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: To whom coming as unto a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen of God and precious, Ye also as living stones are built up, a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God thro' Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Therefore to you who believe, he is precious: but to them who believe not, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner. And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, to them who stumble, not believing the word, whereunto also they were appointed. But ye are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a purchased people, that ye may shew forth the virtues of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: Who in time past were not a people, but now are the people of God; who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly desires, which war against the soul, Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the king as supreme, Or to governors, as sent by him, for the punishment of evil-doers, and the praise of them that do well. For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: As free, yet not having your liberty for a cloak of wickedness, but as the servants of God. Honour all men, Love the brotherhood, Fear God, Honour the king, Servants be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if when ye commit faults and are buffeted, ye take it patiently? But if when ye do well and suffer, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto are ye called; for Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye might follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: Who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin might live to righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned to the shepherd and bishop of your souls. In like manner, ye wives, be subject to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they also may, without the word, be won by the conversation of the wives, Beholding your chaste conversation joined with fear: Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of curling the hair, and of wearing gold, or of putting on apparel, But the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price. For thus the holy women also of old time who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands, As Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children ye are while ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. In like manner, ye husbands, dwell according to knowledge with the woman, as the weaker vessel; giving them honour, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. Finally, Be ye all of one mind, sympathizing with each other, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are called to this, to inherit a blessing. For he that loveth life and desireth to see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips, that they speak no guile: Let him turn from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers, but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But even if ye do suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye; and be not afraid of their terror, neither be ye troubled, But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: And be always ready to give an answer to every one that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear: Having a good conscience, that whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing. For Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but raised to life by the spirit, By which likewise he went and preached to the spirits in prison, Who some time disbelieved, when the long-suffering of God waited in the Days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, wherein few, that is, eight persons were saved through the water: The antitype whereof, baptism, now saveth us, (not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Who being gone into heaven, is on the right-hand of God, angels, and authorities, and powers being subjected to him. Seeing then Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind:(for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin) That ye may no longer live the rest of your time in the flesh, to the desire of men, but to the will of God. For the time past of your life sufficeth to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when ye walked in lasciviousness, evil desires, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries. Wherein they think it strange, that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you, Who shall give account to him that is ready judge the living and the dead. For to this end was the gospel preached to them that are dead also, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit. But the end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. And above all things, have fervent love to each other; for love will cover a multitude of sins. Use hospitality one to another without grudging. As every one hath received a gift, so minister it one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God: if any man minister, let him minister as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified thro' Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the might for ever and ever. Amen. Beloved, wonder not at the burning which is among you, which is for your trial, as if some strange thing befell you: But as ye partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may likewise rejoice with exceeding great joy. If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil-spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other mens matters, Yet if any suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. For the time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God: but if it begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator. The elders that are among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and likewise a partaker of the glory which shall be revealed, Feed the flock of God which is among you, overseeing it not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy gain, but of a ready mind, Neither as lording over the heritage, but being examples to the flock. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away. In like manner, ye younger, submit yourselves to the elder, and be ye all subject to each other. Be ye cloathed with humility; for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. Watch: be vigilant: for your adversary the devil, walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour: Whom resist, stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. Now the God of all grace, who hath called us by Christ Jesus to his eternal glory, after ye have suffered a while, himself shall perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. To him be the glory and the might for ever and ever. Amen. By Silvanus, a faithful brother, as I suppose, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and adding my testimony, that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand, The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you, and Mark my son. Salute ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus.Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us, thro' the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, thro' the knowledge of God, and of Jesus, our Lord; As his divine power hath given us all things that pertain to life and godliness, thro' the knowledge of him that hath called us by glory and virtue, By which he hath given us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these, having escaped the corruption which is in the world thro' desire, ye may become partakers of the divine nature: For this very reason giving all diligence, add to your faith courage, and to courage knowledge, And to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, And to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love. For these being in you and abounding, make you neither slothful nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that wanteth these is blind, not able to see afar off, having forgotten the purification from his old sins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, be diligent to make your calling and election firm; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Wherefore I will not neglect always to remind you of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the present truth, Yea I think it right, so long as I am in this tabernacle to stir you up by reminding you: Knowing that shortly I must put off my tabernacle, even as the Lord Jesus Christ shewed me. But I will endeavour, that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty. For he received honour and glory from God the Father, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight. And we being with him in the holy mountain, heard this voice coming from heaven: And we have the word of prophecy more confirmed, to which ye do well that ye take heed, as to a lamp that shone in a dark place, till the day should dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: Knowing this before that no scripture prophecy is of any private interpretation. For prophecy never came by the will of man, but the holy men of God spake being moved by the Holy Ghost. But there were false prophets also among the people, as there shall likewise be false teachers among you, who will privily bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of truth will be evil spoken of. And through covetousness will they with feigned speeches make merchandize of you, whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not. For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, delivered them to chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment, And spared not the old world, (but he saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness) bringing a flood on the world of the ungodly; And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example to them that should afterwards live ungodly: And delivered righteous Lot, vexed with the filthy behaviour of the wicked:(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds). The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unrighteous to the day of judgment to be punished. But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government: presumptuous, self-willed; they are not afraid to rail at dignities: Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, bring not a railing accusation against them before the Lord. But these, as natural brute beasts, born to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things they understand not, and shall perish in their own corruption, Receiving the reward of unrighteousness. They count it pleasure to riot in the day time; spots and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings, while they feast with you, Having eyes full of adultery, and that cease not from sin; beguiling unstable souls, having hearts exercised with covetousness, accursed children: Who have forsaken the right way and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Boser, who loved the reward of unrighteousness. But he had a rebuke for his iniquity: the dumb ass, speaking with man's voice, forbad the madness of the prophet. These are wells without water, clouds driven by a tempest, to whom the blackness of darkness is reserved for ever. For by speaking swelling words of vanity, they allure thro' the desire of the flesh, thro' wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them that live in error. While they promise them liberty, themselves are the slaves of corruption; for by whom a man is overcome, by him he is also brought into slavery. For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, thro the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again intangled therein and overcome, their last state is worse then the first. For it had been better for them, not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. But it has befallen them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. This second epistle, beloved, I now write to you, in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: Knowing this first, that there will come scoffers in the last days, walking after their own desires, Saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they are willingly ignorant of, that by the word of God of old the heavens were and the earth, standing out of the water and in the water, Thro' which the world that then was, being overflowed with water perished. But the heavens and the earth that are now, are by his word kept in store reserved unto fire, against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. But, beloved, be not ye ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow concerning his promise (tho' some men count it slowness) but is long-suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up. Seeing then all these things are dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, Looking for and hastning the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we look for new heavens and a new earth, according to his promise, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing ye look for these things, labour to be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless. And account the long-suffering of our Lord salvation, as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given him , hath written to you: As also in all his epistles, speaking therein of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction. Ye, therefore, beloved, knowing these things before, beware, lest ye also being led away by the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness: But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity! Amen.That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have beheld, and our hands have handled of the word of life: For the life was manifested, and we have seen, and testify and declare to you the eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested to us: That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ: And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full. And this is the message which we have heard of him and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say, we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful, and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say, we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. My beloved children, I write these things to you, that ye may not sin. But if any one sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous, And he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that faith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, verily in him the love of God is perfected: hereby we know that we are in him. He that saith, he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. Beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but the old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. Again, I do write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you: for the darkness is past away, and the true light now shineth. He that saith, he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness until now. He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because darkness hath blinded his eyes. I have written to you, beloved children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name sake. I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written to you young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world: if any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the desire thereof; but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever. Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that Antichrist cometh, so even now there are many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us. But ye have an anointing from the Holy one, and know all things. I have not written to you, because ye know not the truth; but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Who is that liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist who denieth the Father and the Son. Whosoever denieth the Son, he hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son, hath the Father also. Therefore let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning: if that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son and in the Father. And this is the promise which he hath promised us, eternal life. These things have I written to you, concerning them that seduce you. But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any should teach you, save as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie; and as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in them. And now, beloved children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. If ye know, that he is righteous, ye know that every one who doth righteousness is born of him. Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know, when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself even as he is pure. Whosoever committeth sin, transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth, seeth him not, neither knoweth him. Beloved children, let no one deceive you. He that practiseth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning: to this end the son of God was manifested, to destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed abideth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. Hereby the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil: whosoever practiseth not righteousness is not of God; neither he that loveth not his brother. For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we love one another. Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know, that we are passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: he that loveth not his brother abideth in death. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murtherer, and ye know that no murtherer hath eternal life abiding in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? My beloved children, let us love not in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And this is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments, abideth in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby ye know the spirit of God: every spirit which confesseth Jesus Christ come in the flesh, is of God. And every spirit which confesseth not Jesus Christ come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and now already it is in the world. Ye are of God, beloved children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. They are of the world; therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. We are of God; he that knoweth God, heareth us: he that is not of God, heareth not us: hereby know we the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love. Hereby was manifested the love of God toward us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son, a propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Hereby we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify, that the Father sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whosoever shall confess, that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. And we know and believe the love that God hath to us. God is love, and he that abideth in love, abideth in God, and God in him. Hereby is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, love his brother also. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; and every one who loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him. Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous. For whosoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? This is he that came by water and blood; even Jesus Christ; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood: and it is the Spirit who testifieth; because the Spirit is truth. For there are three that testify on earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and these three agree in one. And there are three that testify in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; and this is the testimony of God, which he hath testified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the testimony in himself. He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the testimony which he hath testified of his Son. And this is the testimony, that God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the Son of God. And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us. And if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we asked of him. If any one see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, let him ask, and he will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for that. All unrighteousness is sin: but there is a sin not unto death. We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is born of God keepeth himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not. We know, that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one. But we know that the Son of God is come; and he hath given us an understanding that we may know the true one; and we are in the true one, even in his Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God and eternal life. Beloved children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.The elder unto the elect Kuria and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but likewise all who know the truth, For the truth's sake, which abideth in us, and shall be with us for ever. Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in the truth, as we received commandment from the Father. And now I beseech thee, Kuria, (not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we had from the beginning ) that we may love one another. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye may walk in it. For many seducers are entered into the world, who confess not Jesus Christ that came in the flesh. This is the seducer and the antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not the things we have wrought, but receive a full reward. Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If any come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed. For he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evil deeds. Having many things to write to you, I was not minded to write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. The children of thy elect sister salute thee. Amen.The elder unto the well-beloved Caius, whom I truly love. Beloved, I wish above all things, that thou mayst prosper and be in health, as thy soul prospereth. For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came, and testified of the truth that is in thee, as thou walkest in the truth. I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children walk in the truth. Beloved, thou dost faithfully whatsoever thou dost to the brethren and to strangers, Who have testified of thy love before the church; whom if thou send forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well. For they went forth for his sake, taking nothing of the Gentiles. We ought therefore to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers to the truth. I wrote to the church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore if I come I will remember his wicked deeds which he doth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that is a doer of good is of God, but he that is a doer of evil, hath not seen God. Demetrius hath a good testimony from all men, and from the truth itself: yea, we also bear testimony, and ye know that our testimony is true. I had many things to write; but I will not write to thee with ink and pen. But I trust to see thee shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are beloved of God the Father, and preserved through Jesus Christ, and called, Mercy unto you, and peace, and love be multiplied. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you and exhort you, to contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were of old described before with regard to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. I am therefore willing to remind you, who once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. And the angels, who kept not their first dignity, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, which in the same manner with these gave themselves over to fornication, and went after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. In like manner these dreamers also defile the flesh, despise authority, rail at dignities. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil, he disputed concerning the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. But these rail at all the things which they know not: and all the things which they know naturally, as the brute beasts, in these they are defiled. Wo to them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah. These are spots in your feasts of love, while they banquet with you feeding themselves without fear: clouds without water, driven about of winds; trees without leaves, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. And of these also, Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his holy ones, To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have impiously committed, and of all the grievous things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own desires, and their mouth speaketh great swelling things, having mens persons in admiration for advantage. But ye, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. For they told you, In the last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly desires. These are they who separate themselves, sensual, not having the Spirit. But ye, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying thro' the Holy Spirit. Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. And some, that are wavering, convince; Some save, snatching them out of the fire; on others have compassion with fear, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. Now to Him who is able to keep you from falling, and to preserve you faultless in the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only God, our Saviour, be glory, and majesty, might and authority, both now and to all ages. Amen.The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew his servants the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified them by his angel to his servant John, Who hath testified the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things which he saw. Happy is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein: for the time is near. John to the seven churches which are in Asia; Grace be unto you, and peace from him who is, and who was, and who cometh, and from the seven Spirits that are before the throne, And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first begotten from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth: To him that loved us, and hath washed us from our sins with his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto his God and Father, to him be the glory and the might for ever. Behold he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they who have pierced him: and all the tribes of the earth shall wail because of him. Yea. Amen. I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who cometh, the Almighty. I John, your brother and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom, and patience of Jesus, was in the island Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet, Saying, what thou seest, write in a book and send to the seven churches, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me; and being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks, And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one, like a son of man, cloathed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breast with a golden girdle. His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow, and his eyes as a flame of fire, And his feet like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the voice of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead: and he laid his right-hand upon me, saying, Fear not, I am the First and the Last, And he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and of Hades. Write the things which thou hast seen, and which are, and which shall be hereafter: The mystery of the stars which thou sawest in my right hand and of the seven golden candlesticks. The stars are angels of the churches: and the candlesticks are seven churches. To the angel of the church at Ephesus write, These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right-hand, that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, that thou canst not bear evil men; and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles and are not, and hast found them liars: And hast patience, and hast borne for my name's sake, and hast not fainted. But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: if not, I come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, unless thou repent. But thou hast this, that thou hatest the works of the Nicola?tans, which I also hate. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God. And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write, These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive. I know thy affliction and poverty, (but thou art rich) and the reviling of those who say they are Jews and are not, but a synagogue of Satan. Fear none of those things which thou art about to suffer: behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried, and ye shall have affliction ten days: Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death. And to the angel of the church at Pergamos write, These things saith he who hath the sharp two-edged sword. I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan is; and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, in the days wherein Antipas, my faithful witness was, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. But I have a few things against thee, that thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicola?tans, which I hate. Repent therefore; if not, I come to thee, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh will I give of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which none knoweth, but he that receiveth it. And to the angel of the church at Thyatira write, These things saith the Son of God, who hath eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass. I know thy love and faith, and thy service and patience, and thy last works more than the first. But I have against thee, that thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, who callest herself a prophetess, and teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols. And I gave her time to repent of her fornication; but she will not repent. Behold I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her, into great affliction, unless they repent of her works. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know, that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give you, every man, according to your works. But I say to you, the rest that are at Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will lay upon you no other burden. But what ye have, hold fast till I come. And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.(And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces) as I also have received from my Father. And I will give him the morning star. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. And to the angel of the church at Sardis write, These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars, I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, but art dead. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, which are ready to die; for I have not found thy works compleat before my God. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast and repent. If thou watch not, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee. Yet thou hast a few names in Sardis, who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: they are worthy. He that overcometh, he shall be cloathed in white raiment, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name, before my Father and before his angels. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia write, These things saith the Holy, the True One, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and none shutteth, and shutteth and none openeth. I know thy works, (behold I have given before thee an opened door, none can shut it) that thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. Behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie, behold, I will make them come and lie down before thy feet, and know that I have loved thee. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee, from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. I come quickly. Hold fast what thou hast, that none take thy crown. He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and my new name. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. And to the angel of the church at Laodicea write, These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: O that thou wert cold or hot! So because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot; I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayst, I am rich, and have inriched myself, and have need of nothing, and knowest not, that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified in the fire, that thou mayst be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayst be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayst see. Whomsoever I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me. He that overcometh, I will give him to sit with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. After this I saw, and behold a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, as of a trumpet talking with me, said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. And immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne. And he that sat, was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone; and a rainbow was round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon. And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones, and on the thrones four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and upon their heads crowns of gold. And out of the throne go forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire burn before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. And before the throne is a sea as of glass, like crystal; and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind. And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature was like a calf, and the third living creature had a face as a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; round about and within they are full of eyes: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who cometh. And when the living creatures give glory, and honour, and thanks, to him that sitteth upon the throne, that liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sitteth upon the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Worthy art thou, O Lord our God, to receive the glory, and the honour, and the power, for thou hast created all things, and through thy will they are, and were created. And I saw in the right-hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? And none in heaven, or in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, that none was found worthy to open the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith to me, Weep not; behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and the seals thereof. And I beheld in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as if he had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right-hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one an harp, and golden phials full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, And hast made them unto our God kings and priests, and they shall reign over the earth. And I saw and heard a voice of many angels, round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power, and the riches, and the wisdom, and the strength, and the honour, and the glory, and the blessing. And every creature which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that are in them, I heard them all saying, To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, is the blessing, and the honour, and the glory, and the power, for ever and ever. And the four living creatures said Amen: and the elders fell down and worshiped. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as the voice of thunder, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come. And there went forth another horse that was red; and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another; and there was given him a great sword. And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come. And I saw, and behold a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. And I saw and behold a pale horse, and he that sat on him, his name was Death, (and Hades followeth even with him) and power was given him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the scimetar, and with famine, and with death, and by the beasts of the earth. And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, thou Holy One and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth? And there was given to them, to every one, a white robe; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a time, till their fellow servants also and their brethren should be fulfilled, who should be killed even as they were. And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun was black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon was as blood; And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree casteth its untimely figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind: And the heaven departed as a book that is rolled together, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave, and every free man hid themselves in the caves, and in the rocks of the mountains: And said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and cover us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? And after this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds, that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, Saying, Hurt ye not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, till we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads. And I heard the number of them that were sealed; an hundred forty four thousand were sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Israel. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Napthali were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. After this I saw, and behold a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and tribes, and people, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palms in their hands. And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the throne and the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God saying, Amen: the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the strength, be to our God for ever and ever. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these that are cloathed in white robes? and whence are they come? And I said to him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who come out of great affliction, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple, and he that sitteth upon the throne shall have his tent over them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them, and will lead them to living fountains of water: and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour. And I saw the seven angels which stand before God, and seven trumpets were given them. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given him, that he might place it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne. And the smoke of the incense came up before God out of the angels hand with the prayers of the saints. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it upon the earth, and there were thunderings, and lightnings, and voices, and an earthquake. And the seven angels, who had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound. And the first sounded, and there was hail, and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all the green grass was burnt up. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire, was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood, And the third part of the creatures that were in the sea which had life died, and the third part of the ships was destroyed. And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star burning as a lamp, and it fell on the third part of the rivers, and on the fountains of waters. And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and many men died of the waters, because they were bitter. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for the third part thereof, and the night likewise, And I saw and heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Wo, wo, wo to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels who are yet to sound. And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star falling from heaven upon the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit. And out of the smoke there went forth locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power: And it was commanded them, not to hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads. And it was given them, not to kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and the torment of them is as the torment of a scorpion, when he stingeth a man. And in those days the men shall seek death, but not find it; and shall desire to die, but death will flee from them. And the appearances of the locusts are like horses made ready for battle; and on their heads are as it were crowns like gold, and their faces are as the faces of men, And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. And they had breast-plates as it were breast-plates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. And they have tails like scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their power is, to hurt men five months. And they have over them a king, the angel of the bottomless pit: his name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek he hath the name Apollyon. One wo is past: behold there come yet two woes after this. And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four corners of the golden altar which is before God, Saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates. And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for the hour, and day, and month, and year, to kill the third part of men. And the number of the army of horsemen was two hundred millions: I heard their number. And thus I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them, having breast-plates of fire and hyacinth and brimstone: and the heads of the horses are as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths goeth fire, and smoke and brimstone. By these three plagues were the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone which went out of their mouths. For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt. And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood, which can neither hear, nor see, nor walk: Neither repented of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts. And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon his head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book opened, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth. And he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth; and while he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders have uttered, and write them not. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his right hand toward heaven, And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, There shall be no more a time. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound, the mystery of God shall be fulfilled, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake with me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who standeth on the sea and on the earth. And I went to the angel, saying to him, Give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take and eat it up, and it will make thy belly bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in thy mouth. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he saith to me, Thou must prophesy again concerning people, and nations, and tongues, and many kings. And there was given me a reed, like a measuring rod; and he said, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. But the court which is without the temple cast out and measure it not: for it is given to the Gentiles: and they shall tread the holy city forty two months. And I will give to my two witnesses to prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth. And if any one would hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies, and if any would kill them, he must thus be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophesying, and have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the wild beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, shall make war with them, and conquer them, and kill them. And their dead bodies shall be in the street of the great city, which is called spiritual Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified, And some of the people, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, shall behold their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in a grave. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and shall make merry, and send gifts to one another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth. And after the three days and an half, the spirit of life from God came into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that saw them. And I heard a great voice saying from heaven to them, Come up hither. And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them. And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and there were slain in the earthquake seven thousand men, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second wo is past: behold the third wo cometh quickly. And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the four and twenty elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God, Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who is, and who was, because thou hast taken thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were wroth: and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they be judged, and to give a reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, small and great, and to destroy them that destroyed the earth. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of the covenant was seen in the temple, and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail. And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. And being with child she crieth, travailing in birth and pained to be delivered. And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads. And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and casteth them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, that when she had brought forth, he might devour the child. And she brought forth a man child, who shall rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that they may feed her twelve hundred and sixty days. And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels: And he prevailed not, neither was his place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, the antient serpent, who is called the devil and satan, who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out unto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come the salvation, and the might, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our brethren is cast out, who accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them: Wo to the earth and the sea; for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath; because he knoweth he hath but a little time. And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman that had brought forth the male child. And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is fed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream. But the earth helped the woman, and opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river which the dragon had cast out of his mouth. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went forth to make war with the rest of her seed who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus. And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a wild beast, coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads a name of blasphemy. And the wild beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and the whole world wondered after the wild beast, And worshiped the dragon, because he gave the authority to the wild beast; and worshiped the wild beast, saying, Who is like the wild beast? and who can war with him? And there was given him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy, and authority was given him forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, even them that dwell in heaven. And it was given him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and authority was given him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation. And all that dwell upon the earth will worship him, whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb, who was slain, from the foundation of the world. If any one have an ear, let him hear. If any leadeth into captivity, he goeth into captivity: if any man kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faithfulness of the saints. And I saw another wild beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, but he spake like a dragon; And he exerciseth all the authority of the first wild beast before him; and he caused the earth, and them that dwelt therein, to worship the first wild beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doth great wonders, so that he even maketh fire to come down out of heaven on the earth in the sight of men. And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the wonders which it is given him to do before the wild beast: saying to them that dwell on the earth, to make an image to the wild beast, which had the wound by the sword, and yet lived. And it was given him to give breath to the image of the wild beast; so that the image of the wild beast should speak: and he will cause, that as many as will not worship the image of the wild beast shall be killed. And he causeth all, small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slaves, to receive a mark in their right-hand, or in their forehead, That no man might buy or sell, but he that had the mark, the name of the wild beast, or the number of his name. Here is the wisdom. Let him that hath an understanding count the number of the wild beast: for it is the number of a man: and his number is six hundred sixty six. And I saw and behold a Lamb standing on mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads. And I heard a voice out of heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as a voice of a great thunder; and the voice which I heard was as of harpers harping on their harps. And they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and none could learn the song but the hundred forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth. These are they who had not been defiled with women; for they are virgins: these are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were bought from among men: first-fruits to God and the Lamb. And in their mouth there was found no guile: they are without fault. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having an everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and fountains of water. And another angel followed, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen; she that hath made all nations drink of the wine of her fornication. And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one worship the wild beast and his image, and receive his mark on his forehead or on his head, He shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured unmixt into the cup of his indignation, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever, and they have no rest day or night, who worship the wild beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying to me, Write: From henceforth happy are the dead who die in the Lord: Yea (saith the Spirit) that they may rest from their labours. Their works follow them. And I saw and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud sat one like a son of man, having a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle and reap; for the time to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle, and the earth was reaped. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven; and he also had a sharp sickle. And another angel from the altar, who had power over fire, cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thrust in his sickle upon the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God. And the wine-press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine-press, even to the horses bridles, one thousand six hundred furlongs. And I saw another sign in heaven great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for by them the wrath of God is fulfilled. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that gained the victory over the wild beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing at the sea of glass, and having the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, O King of the nations? Who would not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou only art gracious: for all the nations shall come and worship before thee: for thy judgments are made manifest. After this I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in heaven: And the seven angels that had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure, white linen, and having their breasts girt with golden girdles. And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden phials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power: and none could go into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go, pour out the seven phials of the wrath of God upon the earth. And the first went and poured out his phial upon the earth, and there came a grievous sore on the men that had the mark of the wild beast, and that worshiped his image. And the second poured out his phial upon the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man, and every living soul in the sea died. And the third poured out his phial on the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art, and who wast, the Gracious one, because thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink. They are worthy. And I heard another from the altar, saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty; true and righteous are thy judgments. And the fourth poured out his phial upon the sun; and it was given him to scorch the men with fire. And the men were scorched exceedingly, and blasphemed the name of God, who had power over these plagues: but they repented not to give him glory. And the fifth poured out his phial upon the throne of the wild beast; and his kingdom was darkened. And they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains, and because of their sores, and repented not of their works. And the sixth poured out his phial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared. And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the wild beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs (They are spirits of devils, working miracles) go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them unto the battle of the great day of God, the Almighty.(Behold I come as a thief. Happy is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.) And they gathered them together to the place which is called in the Hebrew Armageddon. And the seventh poured out his phial upon the air, and there went forth a loud voice out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were lightnings, and voices, and a great earthquake; such as had not been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great. And the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and Babylon the Great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And every island fled, and the mountains were not found. And a great hail, every hail-stone about the weight of a talent, falleth out of heaven upon the men; and the men blasphemed God, because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great. And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven phials, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the judgment of the great whore, that sitteth upon many waters: With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet wild beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornification: And on her forehead a name written, Mystery; Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw, I wondered exceedingly. And the angel said to me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. The wild beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth, (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder when they behold the wild beast, that he was, and is not, and yet will be. Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sitteth, And they are seven kings: five are fallen: one is, the other is not yet come; when he cometh, he must continue a short space. And the wild beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not received the kingdom, but receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast. These have one mind, and give their power and authority to the wild beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the wild beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put it into their hearts, to fulfill his will, and to agree and to give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. And after this I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great power, and the earth was inlightned with his glory. And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become an habitation of devils, and an hold of every unclean spirit, and an hold of every unclean beast, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drank of the wine of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich, thro' the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached even to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her even as she hath rewarded, and give her double according to her works; in the cup which she filled, fill to her double. As much as she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: because she saith in her heart, I sit as a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and sorrow, and famine; and she shall be burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. And the kings of the earth, who had committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall weep and mourn over her, when they see the smoke of her burning, Standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas! Thou great city Babylon, thou strong city! In one hour is thy judgment come. And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her; for none buyeth their merchandize any more; Merchandize of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all sorts of thyine wood, and all sorts of vessels of ivory, and all sorts of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble; And cinnamon, and amomum, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep; and merchandize of horses and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men. And the fruits which thy soul desireth are departed from thee, and all things that were dainty and splendid are perished from thee and thou shalt find them no more. The merchants of these things who became rich by her, shall stand afar off, for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, Saying, alas, alas! The great city that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stone, and pearl: in one hour so great riches are become desolate. And every ship-master, and all the company belonging to ships, and sailors, and all who trade by sea, stood afar off, And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city was like the great city? And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas! The great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her costliness; for in one hour she is made desolate. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and apostles, and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mill-stone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee, and no artificer of any kind shall be found any more in thee, and the sound of a mill-stone shall be heard no more at all in thee. And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee, and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more in thee: for thy merchants, were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and saints, and of all that had been slain upon the earth. After this I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah: The salvation, and the glory, and the power to our God. For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand,(And again they said Hallelujah) and her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever. And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down, and worshiped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah. And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, small and great. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord God, the Almighty reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice and give the glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And it is given to her, to be arrayed in fine linen, white and clean; the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. And he saith to me, Write: Happy are they who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me, These are the true sayings of God. And I fell before his feet to worship him: but he saith to me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. And I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sitteth on him, called Faithful and True: and in righteousness he judgeth and maketh war. His eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems, and he hath a name written, which none knoweth but himself. And he is clothed in a vesture dipt in blood, and his name is called, The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in clean, fine linen. And out of his mouth goeth forth a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he may smite the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together to the great supper of God, That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chief captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those that sit on them, and the flesh of all men both bond and free, both small and great. And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together, to make war with him that sat on the horse and with his army. And the wild beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought the miracles before him, with which he deceived them who had the mark of the wild beast, and them who had worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which went forth out of his mouth; and all the birds were satisfied with their flesh. And I saw an angel descending out of heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he might deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled. After this he must be loosed for a small time. And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them; and I saw the souls of them who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the wild beast nor his image, neither had received the mark on their forehead or on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. The rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. Happy and holy is he that hath a part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. And when the thousand years are fulfilled, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go forth to deceive the nations, which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where both the wild beast and the false prophet are: and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat thereon, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things that were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead that were therein; and death and hades gave up the dead that were in them; and they were judged every one according to their works. And death and hades were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away: and there was no more sea. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride, adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, Behold the tabernacle of God with men, and he will dwell with them; and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them and be their God. And he shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall sorrow, or crying, or pain, be any more; because the former things are gone away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new. And he saith to me, Write: these sayings are faithful and true. And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsteth of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be to him a God, and he shall be to me a son. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven phials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, Having the glory of God: her window was like the most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal, Having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and the names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. And the walls of the city had twelve foundations, and upon them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. And he that talked with me had a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the walls thereof. And the city lyeth four-square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs: the length, and the breadth, and the height of it, are equal. And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred forty-four reeds, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. And the building of the wall thereof was jasper, and the city was of pure gold, like clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was a jasper, the second a sapphire, the third a chalcedony, the fourth an emerald, The fifth a sardonyx, the sixth a sardius, the seventh a chrysolite, the eighth a beryl, the ninth a topaz, the tenth a chrysophrase, the eleventh a jacinth, the twelfth an amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass. And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine on it; for the glory of God hath inlightened it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof. And the nations shall walk by the light thereof; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. And the gates of it shall not be shut by day: and there shall be no night there. And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it. But there shall in no wise enter into it any thing common, or that worketh abomination, or maketh a lie, but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life. And he shewed me a river of the water of life clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river is the tree of life, bearing twelve sorts of fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall worship him, And shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads. And there shall be no night there, neither is there need of a lamp, or of the light of the sun; for the Lord God will give them light, and they shall reign for ever. And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: the Lord the God of the holy prophets hath sent his angel, to shew his servants the things which must be done shortly. Behold, I come quickly: happy is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book. And it was I John, who heard and saw these things; and when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who shewed me these things. But he saith to me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the sayings of this book; worship God. And he saith to me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: the time is nigh. He that is unrighteous, let him be unrighteous still; and he that is filthy let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still, and he that is holy, let him be holy still. Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to render to every one as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Happy are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city. Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie. I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you, to the churches, these things. I am the root and the off-spring of David, the bright, the morning-star. And the spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that thirsteth, come: let him that willeth, take the water of life freely. I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man add to them, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part of the tree of life, and the holy city, which are written in this book. He that testifieth these things saith, Yea, I come quickly. Amen: Come, Lord Jesus! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all.""",
